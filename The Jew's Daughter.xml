        rain. Her voice was booming, emphatic, child-like. And now I'm
        wandering in the rain, from coffee shop to coffee shop, notebook
        under my arm. The coffee made me nervous, terribly nervous.
        Good nervous? Don't you usually wear a hat? He asked, wide-
        eyed and smiling. I often wear a hat, I said. And that is the full
        transcription of that first conversation. His greed is what she called

        whatever it was that was so unsettling about him, so loud all
        around him. I don't know what it was. It was sometimes different
        from and darker than just enthusiasm, and sometimes it wasn't. It
        was dynamic and changing, this and then that. It was def‌initely
        assertive. At the risk of painting a picture that is too exotic, too
        dark and gothic-luring, I should not overindulge in something that
        is in no need of embellishment. Needless to say, It was dangerous,
        or had the effect of a dangerous thing on any sensing animal. Of
        course, it was greed, indisputably, not hers though, not having, as
        it didn't, any regard for tactfulness or discrimination, not having,
        as it didn't, a specif‌ic destination, so to speak, nor was it the kind
        of thing that would retreat and undetectably go about its business.
        It could always knock knock knock on another door. It was not
        particularly a seeking greed, which is not to say that it wasn't
        predatorial, but it didn't have the stealth of, say, a lurking tiger. It
        seemed more than anything like a raw feeding thing that had eaten
        its way out and now there it was. A strange arrangement between
        the two, too big for such a little guy, but as to the degree of
        interdependence, were there reigns and who or what was
        regulating them--well, it's a subject for endless conjecture. It was

        The house overlooks a turbid river. Massive, hoary trees loom in a
        jagged line before the sunken porch. Thick-skinned trunks. Large
        disheveled leaves of bark. Their heavy splayed roots sink into the
        wild, hilly lawn. Unkempt, uneven. The heavy metallic river

        way to the library, and the conversation proceeded this way, like a
        persistent interview about nothing in particular, consisting of a few
        questions that repeated in a sort of cycle. He squinted and then

        answered with his head tilted, his eyebrows tight, and his dark eyes

        discomfort I was experiencing because his face was so disturbingly
        close to mine that I could see up his misshapen nostrils. It became
        undeniably clear to me that the majority of his upper teeth were
        missing, that he had a mole on the lower crease of his cheek, and
        that his breath smelled moldy. So...He asked me again how I was
        planning to spend the day and I had to remind him for the third
        time, and was wondering if he were completely impenetrable or if

        intelligent, so hurt, and at the same time, so entirely false. It was
        all facade and yet I could detect nothing behind it. I can't place

        friendly way, in an effort to include me. I have a pitbull also.
        Yeah? Tim Hart. Live around here? Down by the river but only for
        a month. You lookin' for a place? he asked. Maybe. Well I should
        say, reason I ask is just that I'm renting out the bottom floor of my
        house. Four hundred a month. You do work I'll knock the price
        down. You might hear me bangin' my old lady but that's about it.
        Well, I have got to be going Fran. Back to work, said the mechanic.

        trained him myself. Four dollars. I hear that when they're worked
        tip and they bite you, their jaws will lock around your limbs. Well,
