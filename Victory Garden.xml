    <div title="Wadi">
        ...this fairly empty subject strolls... along a hillside at the bottom of which flows a wadi (I use the word to attest to
        a certain alienation); what he perceives is multiple, irreducible, issuing from heterogeneous, detached substances
        and levels: light, colors, vegetation, heat, air, tenuous explosions of sound, tiny cries of birds, children's voices
        f‌rom the other side of the valley, paths, gestures, garments of inhabitants close by or very far away; all these
        incidents are half identifiable: they issue f‌rom known codes, but their combinative operation is unique, it grounds
        the stroll in a dif‌ference which cannot be repeated except as difference.

        This is what happens in the Text...

        Constructive hypertexts require a capability to act: to create, to change, and to recover particular encounters
        within the developing body of knowledge. These encounters... are versions of what they are becoming, a structure
        f‌or what does not yet exist. ... A constructive hypertext should be a tool f‌or inventing, discovering, viewing, and
        testing multiple, alternative, organizational structures....

    <div title="All the Above">
        In all fictional works, each time a man is confronted with several alternatives, he chooses one and eliminates the
        others; in the f‌iction of Ts'ui Pen, he chooses — simultaneously — all of them. He creates, in this way, diverse
        f‌utures, diverse times which themselves also proliferate and fork.

        and it's like each time you make a choice to do one thing instead of something else it creates an entirely
        separate reality where the other thing happened and of course in that reality it really did happen because that's
        the way that reality is....

        "The transaction loop is simple," Urquhart told them. "NVACS compiles its transcript, which is displayed in real
        time on the monitor here." Indicating the western wall. "The transcript takes the form of a simple constructive
        hypertext with unconstrained possibilities for branching."

        Tate smiled indulgently. "What’s that you say, Boris?"

        "Transcript contains many words. Pick a word, any word; pass it to the computer. NVACS specif‌ies its semantic
        and iconolectic correlatives then formulates an appropriate Subliminal Suggestion Holoform (SSH), which it feeds
        back to the human interactor through his personal listening device."

        Tate pointed quizzically at his ears as if to say, you mean headphones ? Urquhart nodded "Ah," said Tate.

        "Gad."

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        You are in your big bed in the black bedroom.

        Outside there are no stars but the constellations on the ceiling are as you left them: Pisces, Cetus, Aquarius... plus
        the new and improved ones: Binky, Solo, and Ike. The stars still shine because <analepsis>you used real radium to paint them</analepsis>
        and that means you probably shouldn't sleep here more than once a month. It also means that the stars can reach
        behind your eyelids. You know what that means. It is Friday the last Friday in the month of Friday of the year
        Friday. The stars are moving. The wheel that carries the stars is moving. You are going away. A gentle rain is
        falling outside the window and the sound of it steepens your slide into sleep. You slip down the slippery slide. It is
        raining inside the room too.

        The rain is generic all over Idealand.

        Rain everywhere. Rain.

        Rain.
        The proximity of a f‌luid.
        A general moistness to the environment.

        This is a deep cue triggering powerful memories. It takes you back, far back. If you permit, it will take you back all
        the way to where you can't know where, but you don't need to go that far. You need only go as far as <analepsis>Paramus, New
        Jersey, a small warehouse and business park of‌f 287 where there is a door marked InnerFace Associates. That's
        right, the tank farm.</analepsis> You are going Inside again. You remember very clearly <analepsis>what Inside is like. Dark, warm, still.</analepsis>
        Then gone for a while. Maybe a long while but probably not a long while.
        Pleasant. Gone.

        Then not so gone. Not so dark or still.

        Is it still raining? How can it be raining here Inside? Because it is raining inside your head, Dummkopy. How did my
        spectral emanation come by this German accent? What happened to Gravity? Do I still need to breathe? What is a
        necktie, really?

        In spite of these questions it is still raining inside and outside your head as the song goes. It has been raining for
        an awfully long time. The world has gotten very wet. The rivers have swollen. The oceans have grown unruly and
        the seas have encroached. The polar caps have slushed. Everything east of the Rockies and west of the Sierras is
        now property of the catf‌ish, who have escaped from the Catf‌ish Death Camps, declared their sentience, and
        convened a Species Crime Tribunal in what was formerly a beachfront of‌f‌ice building in what was formerly Santa
        Monica.

        (a series of slow dissolves here following order-of-magnitude changes of scale as we pull back into the lower
        ionosphere)

        gently gently away away, a dwindling tiny spick of a speck rocking on the waters, borne on the bosom, child of the

        You poke your nose out through the fore hatch of the tank, which isn't a tank anymore but a burnt-orange 24-foot
        daysailer christened the blindy lee of Hoboken NJ.

        "Hey," you note, addressing yourself in the general direction of Upstairs, "Wasn't there an arrangement about this
        sort of thing?"

        There is no, ah, immediate response so you climb to the crow's nest where you f‌ind a wet bar, a can of honey roast
        cashews, and a Postmodern Library copy of Don Quixote. The other one. You pour yourself a drink, gobble a few
        nuts, and toss the book over the rail. <analepsis>You saw the miniseries with Farah Fawcett.</analepsis>

        A split instant before the book touches the water a cerulean dolphin arcs out and snatches it away.

    <div title="Fishy">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You are hanging over the rail watching the f‌ish.

        Okay, he's NOT a f‌ish. Okay, okay, she's NOT a he. You are watching this female dolphin go porpoising in and out
        of your wake. Right. right, a dolphin of the common bottlenose variety. NOT a porpoise and no I never touch
        canned tuna. Can we hold the objections please? Thank you.

        The politically correct dolphin is demonstrating all her remarkable porPoise by f‌risking in and out of your wake.
        Wake? No not now we need you to stay asleep and yes there's a wake because the boat is moving. It's following
        the FISH which keeps giving you this strange look.

    <div title="Dolphins Aren't Fish">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You are looking into the eyes of the dolphin, which is a neat trick since everybody knows a dolphin's eyes are set on
        either side of her great big head.

        But somehow you manage this only in the process you go over the fucking rail and into the drink and there you are
        blowing bubbles and looking like a poorly adapted mammal indeed.

        While the dolphin says ki ki ki or whatever it is that dolphins say in dolphin language, which just like that William
        Shatner you understand perfectly don't ask me how he's supposed to do it extrasensory lipreading or what, go
        f‌igure. And then suddenly it hits you — dolphins don't have lips!

        Don't forget to write the f‌ish says somehow.

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Since <analepsis>you fell into this general oceanic condition</analepsis> you seem to have sunk a great way.

        You look up and there's the sun looking like a cheap fresnel behind a lot of blue-green gels. You go down and down
        all the while ref‌lecting that it's a good thing this is a dream because otherwise you'd probably look like a
        squeezed-out sponge about now: not to mention the fact that your lungs would be full of water.

        And maybe they are: but like the poet says: you breathe dif‌ferently down here.

        And sure enough there it is: eleven dozen fathoms below the soles of your Nikes — the Wreck.

    <div title="Into the Wreck">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You are inside the Wreck. It looks very much like a Seven-Eleven Superstore with a serious drainage problem.
        Annelids and coral animals have colonized the candy shelves. A pugnacious-looking spider crab is lounging
        around the beer cooler. The tabloids have all run back to slurry. The counter person has pearls that were his eyes.
        Damn, you think, I'll bet this means the Slurpee machine is down. On the video rack you notice that book you threw
        overboard earlier only now the title reads:

        SKULL FRACTALS TOO, MORE RUDE BIKER POETRY IN HONOR 0F BENOIT MANDELBROT.

        You open the book and f‌ind it's full of stars.

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Now that the book is open you decide to switch it on. Its wheels and pullies go round around with all the
        appearance of high seriousness. Its little magnetos shake and shimmy. "Don't touch that dial!" the book advises.
        You touch that dial and fourteen little plastic penguins run down the curvilinear slope like little plastic penguins on a
        curvilinear slope. Somewhere in a room far away in the dark a telegraph line crackles to life. Food riots have broken
        out at the Watergate. The White Tornado appears like the genius of the lamp and you have a feeling it doesn't mean
        well. The little batwinged fellow with pointed teeth tugs at the hem of your macintosh and says why don't you
        answer your page. You realize the book has been speaking to you.
        It—It's —It's the —
        the end of the world as we know it this book f‌inally manages to say. You try to keep up your skepticism but this
        time it happens to be

        true.

        Tate was dealing from the middle of the deck again. "Well I'm certainly impressed." he of‌fered.

        "I don't understand." Weinburger objected.

        "We'll need to meet again later this month to discuss commercial and military implications of this research. Call
        Wesley in my off‌ice with your preferred times."

        They got up and f‌iled out of the room. Urquhart studied his cards. Seven of diamonds, three of spades, seven of
        diamonds, three of spades, ace of clubs. Macarthur leaned in and gave him the V-sign again. He still had on the
        sleepshades.

        Beneath English trees I meditated on that lost maze: I imagined it erased by rice f‌ields or beneath the water; I

    <div title="Pragmatics">
        "The problem with all this." Tate mused. "is that I don't believe in coincidence."

        Heidel shrugged, standing in the darkness. What Tate might or might not believe mattered little to him. Tate was
        after all a pragmatist: what mattered above all was what he would choose to do.

        "I don't care how the war came about." Heidel called up to him. "It's here now. It def‌ines the conditions with which
        we have to work"

        "What?" Tate said, clearly distracted.

        "The war." Heidel repeated, beginning to grow peevish.

        "Oh yes." said Tate. "There's the war, yes."
    </div>

    <div title="Conservative">
       <prolepsis>Heidel's impatience began to mount. He didn't care much for Tate. He wasn't even sure he respected him. Who was
        this Provost of theirs, anyway? — a bureaucrat of long standing with powerful connections in both parties, a man
        who'd <analepsis>spent time in the space program, the aerospace industry, and (according to rumor) the intelligence community.</analepsis>
        A shuf‌fler of contracts, a manager of programs. An ombudsman, a dealmaker, perhaps a f‌ixer.

        Tate's political views were probably conservative, if he had any to speak of. Though they were not conservative in
        a way that Heidel appreciated. Like <analepsis>'progressive' and 'liberal' in years gone by,</analepsis> the term 'conservative' had taken on
        many meanings, some of them schismatically opposed. Tate's conservatism was of the quietistic, risk-averse kind. It
        was, Heidel thought, a coward's conservatism, a belief in always f‌ighting another day.

        Heidel thought dif‌ferently, of course.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Important">
        <prolepsis>"Oh I'm sure the war was no coincidence, either," Tate said presently. He spoke quietly, almost as if to himself, but
        his voice carried clearly through the dome.

        "I'm not interested in leftwing conspiracy theories," Heidel told him.

        "No..."

        Under their feet a very large motor spun brief‌ly, then sank back to sleep.

        "It's odd, isn't it," Tate went on. "Most citizens of the free world are probably riveted to their television sets right
        now, fascinated by what's going on in the sky halfway around the world"

        "It's a very important moment in history," Heidel observed.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Serious Business">
        <prolepsis>"Oh I'm sure it is," Tate replied. "The war, the big story." He paused to key in an adjustment. A second, smaller
        motor f‌licked on for a few seconds and a hydraulic line hissed. "How close we can come to the truth and yet still be
        utterly ignorant."

        "What are you talking about?" Heidel demanded.

        Tate made him wait another moment or two before he answered. "The real story's in the sky, all right, but it isn't
        necessarily the sky over Baghdad. There's a good deal more going on tonight than most people suspect."

        Heidel felt himself pass beyond peevishness and vexation until he was totally fed up. <analepsis>He'd come here, tonight of all
        nights, to talk some very serious business</analepsis> — and all Tate could talk about was his amateur astronomy.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Warning">
        <prolepsis>"This is truly amazing," Tate said, speaking for his own benef‌it again. "I'd ask you to join me in the cage," he
        apologized, "but there's very little room here and I'm not sure that what you'd see would make sense to you."
        Heidel snapped his briefcase shut, incensed. "I'm sorry." he said. "but I didn't come all the way out here to look at
        the planets. I came to warn you about what you'll f‌ind in Monday's mail."

        There was another longish pause. "Wesley handles the mail." Tate said. "Why don't you speak to him?"

        Heidel picked up his case and readied himself to go. "I believe this matter demands your most direct and serious
        attention." he insisted. "But if you'd rather discuss it later, you know where I can be reached."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Close">
        <prolepsis>"I do indeed." said Tate, but Heidel didn't hear him because he was already in the hallway doing his best to slam a
        door that had been carefully designed so it couldn't be slammed.

        Tate meanwhile went on with his viewing. Af‌ter a bit he looked away from the eyepiece, glanced at a bank of
        readouts, and punched up a program on his laptop. The screen cycled through a simple simulation of a three-body
        trajectory problem. One body was very large, the second less than half so large, and the third a mere speck. Tate
        pressed a key and the speck began to move, sailing in an accelerating arc between the two large bodies then
        swinging off into unrepresented space.

        The sound of Heidel's car starting reached Tate through the open aperture, breaking his concentration.

        "Amazing" he said under his breath. "What an amazingly close call."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Timely">
        Scholar and showman, Urquhart knew in all his most sensitive bones that this was the time. There was a furious
        logic to this day-after-the-day, a logic he would have recognized even without <analepsis>Tate's nudge and a wink and "my
        friends around the Beltway" over lunch.</analepsis>

        He could feel the timing. He could feel a lot of things. <analepsis>Something had been at work in the world, some wavefront of
        rapid change only dimly felt but no less powerf‌ul for that.</analepsis> The waves passed through everything and everyone,
        transforming as they went. You only had to check the mirror.

        Urquhart knew all about it, but still when the moment came he found himself charged and restless, unable to sit and
        watch. A troubled man. So as darkness stole down the western sky, Urquhart opened his back door and stepped
        out into the scrub.

        "Where is he this time?" Victor Gardner demanded.

        Mild-mannered Macarthur polished his shades, readying a soft answer for all this graduate wrath. "Where's who?"
        "The other half of this comedy act. Your so-called straight man. My so-called thesis adviser. Urquhart."

        Jude Busch blew out a huge pink bubble and shif‌ted her gum to the other cheek. "Victor, you do this every time we
        meet and it's getting old, old, old."

        "I don't think Dr. Urquhart really exists," Amanda Fairbairn theorized. "Not that it's a problem, really." You could
        say things like that when you were a f‌if‌teen—year-old Presidential Research Fellow.

        <prolepsis>"I'm complaining to the Dean." Victor fulminated. "Urquhart's supposed to be teaching this seminar, not you,
        Macarthur. This is our fourth meeting of the term and he hasn't showed up once."

        Macarthur spread his hands. "Boris would be with us if he could."

        "If he could be bothered." said Victor.

        "If he could remember." Amanda put in.

        "The man is a fraud, an impostor." Victor insisted

        "Well," Jude ref‌lected, "is that so special?"</prolepsis>

    <div title="The Text">
        <prolepsis>"Which brings us to our text for tonight." Macarthur threw in, knowing the segue was lame but going for it anyway.
        "A story about espionage and detection. A tale of murder and communication, coincidence and crossed identities.
        A narrative essay on necessity and the nature of time."

        "Garbage," Victor sniped. "Drivel. The Garden of Forking Bullshit. More like totally unnecessary and a
        huge waste of time. I think Urquhart is afraid to show up because he might have to hear how stupid his reading list
        is."

        "At least Victor is consistent," Amanda observed. "He hates everything."

        "I dunno," Jude Busch confessed. "I thought the story sucked, too."

        "Aw, gee," said Macarthur.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Foregone Conclusion">
        <prolepsis>"Actually," Jude said after a moment's pause, "I think Borges was being pretty damn cynical. That story's not about
        the open-endedness of time. It's about a guy who only has one option, so he uses it and gets hung." She put her
        head on one side, stuck out her tongue and yanked an imaginary noose.

        Victor Gardner slapped his forehead. "O wow, so that's the ending."

        "End of his rope, end of the line," chimed in Amanda.

        "Now wait just a darned minute," Macarthur protested.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Parable">
        <prolepsis>"Hold on," Macarthur rallied. "Okay, yeah, the story ends with a death but didn't it occur to you that might be
        ironic? Suppose the story's really a parable—"

        Jude snickered. "Get serious. It's a theoretical joke. 'Time is really multiple,' oh sure. But the story isn't, is it? If you
        ask me, Borges was just gassing of‌f. He was a printhead after all — and not even a novelist. He didn't really care
        about manyness, matrices, or multiples. He really wanted things plain and singular. Something you can get your
        hands around, see?" She gave a limp-wristed demonstration.

        "Say what?" said Macarthur.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Patron">
        <prolepsis>Macarthur knew that <analepsis>somewhere back there he had lost all traces of Authority,</analepsis> but he tried a last-ditch effort
        anyway. "It didn't occur to you that the story might be like a probe toward some alternative form of consciousness,
        or—or being ?"

        All three rolled their eyes in the same direction. "Oh right," Victor said. "Mind expansion. Evolution of the
        sensorium. Like what your patron saint McLuhan was into."

        Macarthur sort of frowned. "Marshall was... misunderstood."

        "Must have been all the drugs," Victor sneered.

        "What were the sixties really like?" Amanda wanted to know.

        Macarthur stared at her. "Partly cloudy." he said.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Name That Game">
        "So," Tate shuf‌fling cards, def‌ily cutting, dealing as usual from the middle of the deck. "What sort of game do we
        play tonight?"

        Urquhart took his customary six beats before replying. It was a part of the act he came to enjoy more and more. The
        disquieting effect of silence, the steady build of suspense. He made a slow survey up and down the seminar table,
        reading the signs of skepticism, embarrassment, morbid curiosity. He examined his cards. Three deuces, the Hanged
        Man, and an undressed woman advertising auto parts.

        "The name of this game is Dream Along With Me." Urquhart declared. "But f‌irst a word or two."
    </div>

    <div title="Theatrical">
        "Execute Lights," Urquhart said. The overhead lamps dimmed smoothly as the room heard and obeyed. Urquhart
        laid his cards on the table and fanned them. "Screens," he called. Nothing happened.

        "Screens?" he tried again. Still negative function. "Screens pleece," he said f‌inally, falling back on the Boris
        Badenov voice which this software seemed to prefer.

        Drive motors hummed and at either end of the room the whiteboards rolled back and the big displays behind them
        ticked to life.
    </div>

    <div title="East">
        <prolepsis>The images on the screens brightened and stabilized.

        The display at the eastern end of the room carried live video from Urquhart's of‌ice down the hall. A large man
        wearing a bowling shirt and headphones was stretched out on a truly ugly Italian couch. His sleeping cap was wired
        for EEG.

        "My colleague," Urquhart explained, "Dr. Miles Macarthur of the Institute for Hypermedia Operations and
        Procedures in Las Vegas. Dr. Macarthur will be our human interactor this evening."

        Macarthur f‌lashed a V-sign at the camera, yawned and pulled on a pair of red felt sleepshades.

        "Nighty night."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="West">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart turned to the opposite wall. The display there was partitioned into four unequal rectangles. One window
        showed the moving wave tracks from the EEG. There looked to be a lot of curious activity along the alpha trace. A
        second window contained a real-time contour map, updated on the half-second, tracing the interaction of several
        mysterious variables: skin conductivity, blood cholesterol, Amazon deforestation. It looked like the crinkled surface
        of a strange planet. In the third window was the obligatory Mandelbrot image, totally irrelevant but fun to stare at
        when the demo got boring.

        The largest window, dead center in the screen, was f‌illed with f‌lickering strings of words.

        "NVACS," Urquhart announced. "The other player in tonight's game."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Envax Scamdee">
       <prolepsis>"Dr. Macarthur will be interfacing with our latest prototype Neuro-Verbal Analog Conversion System (NVACS), or
        as the press insist on calling it, the 'dream processor.' Tonight's session represents our f‌irst opportunity to run on
        the new Ohno-Sendak Superchaotic Analog Matrix Device (SCAMD) with enhanced fuzzy logic. As you will see,
        the unique capabilities of this platform allow us to expand signif‌icantly the scope of our research."

        Urquhart cracked his knuckles tentatively, peering up the table at Tate. The Provost's expression was unreadable.
        Was he amused, bemused, bored? Urquhart decided it didn't matter.

        "Our time on the SCAMD was provided by DARPA's Behavioral Science Division after the helpful intervention of
        Provost Tate."

        There was brief, decorous applause.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Controversial">
        <prolepsis>"As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Macarthur and I do not move with the mainstream of neural interface research. Our
        focus on verbal evocations of mental events is in itself divergent; but we go further. Like everyone else in this f‌ield
        we have set out to create interfaces between the computer and the human mind. Unlike our colleagues, we seek an
        interface not with the conscious mind, but with the Unconscious."

        Urquhart let the awful word linger in the porches of their ears. <fid>Yeah, you heard me.</fid>

        "Most of our colleagues have rejected this approach, sometimes harshly. Our work has been judged impractical.
        We have been called esoterics, mentalists, aesthetes."

        <fid>Not to mention pranksters, con artists, and nut cases.</fid>

        "What you are about to see represents our response."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="I.D.">
        <prolepsis>"All of our ef‌forts to date have been read-only." Urquhart explained. "We've had some success producing synthetic
        verbal descriptions of dream activity. NVACS transcripts have recently achieved semantic correlation coef‌ficients in
        the mid-eighties when compared to our subjects' dream logs; performance improves, obviously, in proportion to the
        extent of baseline data available to the system."

        Weinburger from Sociology looked like nodding off. Urquhart took note.

        "Tonight, however, we will attempt a more ambitious experiment. Gentlemen, you are about to take part in the
        world's f‌irst Interactive Dream."

        Weinburger’s eyes f‌licked open.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Loop">
        <prolepsis>"The transaction loop is simple," Urquhart told them. "NVACS compiles its transcript, which is displayed in real
        time on the monitor here." Indicating the western wall. "The transcript takes the form of a simple constructive
        hypertext with unconstrained possibilities for branching."

        Tate smiled indulgently. "What's that you say, Boris?"

        "Transcript contains many words. Pick a word, any word; pass it to the computer. NVACS specif‌ies its semantic
        and iconolectic correlatives then formulates an appropriate Subliminal Suggestion Holoform (SSH), which it feeds
        back to the human interactor through his personal listening device."

        Tate pointed quizzically at his ears as if to say, you mean headphones? Urquhart nodded. "Ah," said Tate.
        "Thanks."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="In Country">
        "It's an alert," Sergeant Yvonne told them. "Everybody just hang out and be easy."

        "Easy for you," shot back Wiesczniewski, <analepsis>whose fast hands on the sorting line had earned him the name of Whizzer.</analepsis>
        And the Whizzer was right of course. Here they sat on their bunk racks in a converted warehouse in an alien city in
        the f‌irst hours of a real war. Even in the deep of the winter night it was close and hot enough, but they also had on
        their Suits — Chemical and Nuclear Warfare Protective Clothing. Sweatsacks, whole-body condoms, body bags
        with sleeves. There were those who'd rather have the gas.

        Including apparently Private Dexter here, whose attention to detail was lacking. Yvonne came over and tugged his
        headpiece. "Hey asshole, seal your hood."

        Dexter fumbled with the gaskets, grinning. "Okay, Sarge. Now I am ready for love."
    </div>

    <div title="Foxy">
        <prolepsis>"And may I say, Sarge." the Whizzer offered, "you're lookin' quite the fox in that there rubber raincoat."

        "Pause it, Wisenewski," the sergeant told him. "Gimme some of that New Army professionalism like you did when
        the pool reporters came."

        "Well gosh sorry sir." The Whizzer snapped off a gloved salute. "Women in combat, good to go."

        Dexter sniggered through his ventilator. "Long as it keeps your own ass out of the line."

        "Hey, lay off." Emily put her arm around the Whizzer. "The Whiz here's the bravest f‌ighting mailman our country's
        ever known."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Hello Down There">
        <prolepsis>But then the place got very quiet because, uh oh, Something Was Happening. Talk about your military discipline —
        it was as if every trooper in the building had a wire coming out his or her tail, a lead plugged into a companywide bus
        with a single master switch. Somewhere a hand cut that switch and in one beat everyone in barracks went silent,
        waiting.

        There was this sound nobody had heard before. It was a heavy low-frequency rumble: felt f‌irst through the soles of
        your feet but building up fast till it tore at your ears. An airplane, or several, low—f‌lying and unmuf‌fled, closing
        overhead. Right overhead, right now. The f‌loor shook and the f‌limsy sheet-metal walls started to shimmy.

        A terrif‌ied mouse popped out of some panelling near Dexter’s right foot and he booted it in violent ref‌lex. The mouse
        skidded down the row of bunks, spun around and vanished. Emily held her breath.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="One of Our Aircraft">
       <prolepsis>"Holy Jesus," Dexter blurted. "What was that, a fuckin' B-52?"

        Sergeant Yvonne shook her head. "One of those mothers can take the f‌illings right out your teeth." She knew this
        well, having spent some time on the island of Diego Garcia.

        "Big transport, probably," the Whizzer thought. "C-5. Maybe some of those weekend warriors forgot the approach
        pattern and had to do a go-around. Must've thought they were still f‌lying for Air Useless."

        "One of ours, anyway." Emily said.

        "Well yeah," the Whizzer replied. "That much seems obvious."

        There was another silence while everybody waited for someone else to say the unspeakable.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Options">
        <prolepsis>It fell, as usual, to Dexter. "Shit," he noticed. "This war gives you so many interesting options for buying it."

        "Tell us about it. Dexter."

        "Well okay, so maybe it's not D-Day, maybe it's not the jungle — but still, it ain't like you can relax, either. The Iraqis
        got a couple thousand MiGs, they got long-range rockets, they got gas, they got anthrax. Who knows, maybe they
        even got the Bomb."

        "Medium-range," Emily corrected. "Scuds only go a couple hundred miles. Those Frogs don't reach even that far.
        So don't worry, they can't drop anything nasty on us Combat Mailman."

        "Oh right," Dexter replied. "Which is why we're sittin' here in our Tupperware pajamas."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Watch Yourself">
        <prolepsis>"I'll tell you what your biggest worry ought to be, Dexedrine." the Sergeant informed him. "Keeping your prick outa
        the belt drive all that time you playin' with yourself when you should be working."

        "Aw, Sergeant, come on," the Whizzer rose to his defense. "I seen him in the mornings and he ain't got no cause to
        worry." Emily held up her hands about four inches apart and Whizzer moved them an inch closer.

        "I get back to the world I'm gonna get me a nice girl," Sergeant Yvonne sighed. "I can't take these men no more."
        "I'll tell you why I'm sweating," Dexter rejoined. "It's because everybody says we're so safe back here. Support
        service assignment, rear positions only. Yeah. Isn't that just when you're most likely to end up on the Evening
        News?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Why Worry?">
        <prolepsis>"Don't piss your pants about it," the Whizzer admonished. "Nobody said this was a vacation trip. Besides, the jets
        and rockets aren't the worst part. What you really want to look out for is what they used to call that 'f‌ifth column.'
        Terrorists and saboteurs. Some kid in a Mercedes with ten kilos of TNT in the back seat. Or the Walkman with the
        Semtex headphones, that's a neat trick, cracks your skull like a raw egg. Wouldn't want to come across one of those
        jobs stuck in the old bulk sorter, would you Dex."

        "Well gee Mister Wizard, thanks so much for that info." Dexter slapped his buddy upside the hood. "Shit, I can't
        take this no more." Seeing the Sarge looking the other way, Dexter peeled back his headgear and snif‌fed. "Smells
        like a mylar fart in here."

        "Chill, Dexter," Sergeant Yvonne advised. "And get that bag back on your head real quick if you see the Lieutenant
        coming."

        Dexter cracked a smile. "She don't like my face."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Attitude Adjustment">
        <prolepsis>"What I don't like is all this mouth about getting KIA'ed," the Sarge complained. "Can't you guys develop a more
        positive attitude?"

        "Sure, Sergeant," the Whizzer answered. "But it would help if you could score us a few dozen cold beers."

        Yvonne laughed, a strange noise coming through all that plastic drapery. "Too bad, guess what, you're not in the
        fucking Marines." Fed up and sweaty, the Sergeant cracked her own hood and gestured to Emily to do the same.
        "Boo. It do stink in here."

        "The smell of fear," Emily said.

        Sergeant Yvonne gave her a glance that said wrong idea and Emily looked away. "Come on," the Sergeant
        proposed, "let’s leave these boys to scare themselves." She leaned closer. "Check out my locker, let's see if we still
        got some of that camel juice."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Suit Time">
        <prolepsis>Dexter f‌lexed his arms and bicycled his legs, a model of modern military adaptation, ready for the nastiest
        environmental surprise. "Suit time! Just gimme that suit time. I love it!"

        Emily gave her comrade a little bang on the head. "You getting good ventilation, Dex old buddy?"

        "Good to go, good to go! Go anywhere in the suit. Do anything in the suit." Dexter jabbed a fat gloved thumb in
        the air.

        The Sergeant came over looking skeptical. "Hey Runbird. what's with Dexter?"

        Emily pressed the eyepiece of her hood against Dexter’s and had a good hard look. "Could be he's hypoxic," she
        speculated. "Could be he's just a jerkoff."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Power Suit">
        <prolepsis>"Yeah," the Whizzer observed, "with Dexter how can you tell?"

        Dexter was performing what looked vaguely like aikido moves beside his bunk. "Suit time! Suit time! Get me some
        more of that suit time."

        "Dexter, what the f‌uck are you talking about?" Sergeant Yvonne demanded.

        "Love the suit! This thing is my future. This is my ace number one career move. The suit! You gotta love it."
        "Crack his hood before I crack his fuckin' head."

        The Whizzer released the seals and peeled back Dexter's headpiece. "Breathe easy, man."

        "I'm telling you, Cheezwhiz, I'm going places in the suit."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Growth Industry">
        <prolepsis>"You're going straight on report if you don't chill out," Sergeant Yvonne advised.

        Dexter spread his hands. "I'm cool. Really couldn't be cooler. Sorry. I just got carried away with the possibilities. I
        mean, think of all those billions of gallons of vicious stuff laying around out there. Chemical, biomedical, nucular.
        They got salt mines in New Mexico, incinerators in upstate New York. Look guys, I read in the paper they f‌inally ran
        out of room for it in Jersey, so they're starting to truck it out to Pennsylvania and Ohio."

        "Sounds like an overdose of Troma f‌ilms," Emily suspected

        "No listen," Dexter insisted. "There's a great big future for a guy who can really get around in the suit."

        "Somebody zip him back up," the Sergeant said.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Everything in the Suit">
        <prolepsis>"I had this dream," Dexter said as they reclosed his seals. "Actually a kind of fantasy."

        "How nice for you," Emily said. "I don't want to hear about it."

        "I imagine f‌inding some real nice foxy chick, present company excepted of coursem who actually wants to make
        love in the suit.

        "Oh mercy, Dexter's got a rubber kink," the Whizzer lamented.

        "I imagine there's some kind of hermaphordite seals, all these nifty little f‌langes and gaskets that you can, you know,
        get it on through..."

        "Dexter, this is utterly disgusting," Emily told him.

        "Umm," Sergeant Yvonne added, "you one real sick puppy, Dexter."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="All Gone">
        <prolepsis>"...and I imagine the two of us going at it," Dexter went on, "right down there on the f‌loor, just a-haulin' and ballin'
        and gettin' right into it, these two suits all tangled up in a kind of big plastic knot..."

        "I dunno, Dex, I don't think Forum will take this one," the Whizzer judged.

        "...and then you know here come the MP's to break it up and they grab hold and start pawing away but guess what?
        — when they get the suits untangled and undo all the snaps and seals, what do they f‌ind?"

        Emily, Whizzer, and the Sergeant exchanged disgusted glances. "We can imagine."

        "No." Dexter objected. "they don't f‌ind anything at all! We've completely disappeared. Vanished without a trace,
        left no forwarding address. All gone home."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="All Clear">
        <prolepsis>And then there were the sirens going off for the third time that night, though everyone's nerves were too slack to
        respond by now, and this time the P.A. crackled on and announced it was the all-clear at last.

        Throughout the barracks there was the sound of suits being peeled of‌f, cramped limbs stretching, deep breaths
        being fetched.

        Thea paused at her off‌ice door as a little rush of paranoia stole over her. There was a problem here. Light came
        through the frosted glass but she didn't remember leaving the f‌luorescents on. Thea tried the lock and found it set,
        but as she turned the handle she heard the springs of her desk chair creak. Someone crossed toward the door.

        She was looking for the nearest security phone when the door opened and Boris Urquhart poked his head out.
        "Only me." Thea backed up against the wall, staring at the ceiling.

        "Didn't mean to scare you," he apologized. "The door was locked so I came on in."

        She turned, closed her eyes and kicked him in the shin.

        "Shithead."

    <div title="Thea's War">
        The war came to Dorothea Agnew as a great shock, a sudden tidal surge of reality. In spite of herself she had begun
        to think of the business in the Gulf as a kind of relief. It reminded people of a larger world beyond the university, the
        city, and even the Commonwealth of Tara — which took some of the heat off her own case.

        But now it had all come literally home, right into her living room. She and Veronica Runbird knelt like little kids too
        close to the screen, listening to all those grave male voices and trying, between the two of them, to feel their way
        toward sense.

        So much of it seemed contrived, spectacular. She kept telling herself it was only a movie, except it seemed to be
        another David Lynch f‌ilm, a cinema of angst and delusion. The night was full of unfunny jokes. She was seeing a
        report on military intelligence delivered by a bearded tough guy named "Wolf Blitzer." What did it mean? Had there
        been a coup de tube by the World Wrestling Federation? Would the cameras cut now to Atlanta to show Hulk
        Hogan at the anchor desk?

        <prolepsis>Veronica sat with chin on knees. quietly crying. For the second time tonight the same thought seized her. "It can't

        Thea put her arm around Veronica's bony shoulders. "Guess again, kiddo. This one's not academic."

        "I don't believe it," Veronica insisted. "What are we seeing? The same pictures over and over. Some suits talking.
        A lot of slick graphics, like this is some kind of warmup for the Superbowl. We might as well be getting this on the
        radio, like that War of the Worlds that fooled everybody in the f‌ifties."

        "That was 1938, dear. Way before my time of course."

        "Whatever. It still seems wrong to me. Some kind of big show."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Buildup">
        <prolepsis>"You should have been ready for this," Thea pointed out. "We all should." She got out her cigarettes and offered
        one to Veronica.

        "It's been so carefully worked out. Look: we had our last-minute diplomatic exercises, we had our Congressional
        debates, all three days of them. We had our steady buildup of 'defensive' forces in the Gulf since about the second
        week of August. And if you want to go back before that, we had Panama, Grenada, and a couple of airplane f‌ights
        with the Libyans back in the Reagan days, remember? Bush and his people have dreamed about this war for years."
        Veronica watched patterns come and go in the smoke above her face. "Do you really think it was like that — some
        kind of plot?" she wondered.

        Thea shook her head. "Why in the world not?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Games">
        <prolepsis>"Call it a big game," Thea went on, "Call it the end of history, call it your New World Order, whatever name you hang
        on it, it’s got a very elegant logic. Build all these tanks and planes and guns for a war with the Russians but the
        Russians go broke, oops, you just have to f‌ind somebody else to drop the old bombs on so you can go out and buy
        some new bombs. This isn't a war, it's a fucking clearance sale."

        Veronica shook her head. "Except that I don't recall them needing body bags down at Sears."

        Thea stopped a second, hearing her own echoes, realizing that she was off on another lecture. But it was too late,
        the spirit was upon her, and after all, what was Veronica to expect — you ran certain risks when you hung out with
        academics.

        "That's right. kiddo. It's a serious game this time. A very big game."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Big Games">
        <prolepsis>"Big games and nasty games, kiddo. The war's just for starters. There's some major changes in store, especially for
        those of us without a penis. You know what they're thinking. For ten years we tried to teach you Family Values,
        but you wouldn't toe the line, bitch. So now we'11 have to try some new rules. Yeah. They'll come after abortion,
        aff‌irmative action, and free speech early in the day, but why stop there — why not go all the way? Why not give up
        this pretense of equality and accept a society with dif‌ferent levels of entitlement, different classes of citizenship? It's
        their economic policy, after all. So why not go all the way and repeal the 19th Amendment?"

        "Whoa," Veronica responded. "Sounds like you've been on the Western Civ warpath too long."

        "Bingo," Thea cried. "Everything fucking well connects."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Heirloom">
        <prolepsis>"I don't know about this," said Veronica, shaking her hennaed head. "Will the sixties never end?"

        "Not if we're lucky, and I might remind you that you're the one in the tie-dyes here, kiddo."

        Veronica picked at her skirt defensively.<fid> Tie-dyed, yes, but not in any off-the-shelf pattern.</fid> "This isn't f‌rom
        Benetton, it's for real. It was my mom's."

        "An heirloom, oh thanks." Thea put her head between her knees. "You won't understand this, V.R., but when I hear
        things like that I expect somebody to come and hang a plaque around my neck. Y'know, one that says 'National
        Monument.'"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Our Mother">
        <prolepsis>Veronica closed her eyes, trying to silence a voice that had started up in her head. The voice belonged to Lucy, the
        woman who <analepsis>had given birth to Emily and to her, and with whom Veronica had spent the f‌irst f‌ifteen years of her life
        moving from commune to ashram to beach house to suburb.

        The day after her f‌ifteenth birthday she left for good.</analepsis>

        For all that had passed between them. Lucy was her mother and Veronica did love her. She knew that <analepsis>Lucy had
        done her best, strange and askew as that was.</analepsis> There was nonetheless a great gap between them.

        Veronica liked to think of Lucy as some more distant relative, like a cousin in a foreign country. Or an occasional
        voice in her head.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Your Generation">
        <prolepsis>"Okay," Thea conceded, "I can deal with it. I admit it, I’m ancient, I'm old enough to be your mom — probably older.
        So now I get to say things like, 'Well, kiddo, and what does your generation think about the war?' God, it makes me
        feel positively decrepit."

        For a number of reasons. Veronica kept quiet.

        "Do you think there'll be any resistance?" Thea wondered.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Resistance?">
        <prolepsis>Veronica was quiet, thinking back over the last few hours, what she'd seen and done at the No. She thought about
        the blank faces, the focused passivity, the inertia.

        And then she remembered <analepsis>dropping Emily off at the Reserve center a few months back. She remembered seeing her
        own sister in G.I. Jane camo drag, watching her heft her pack, wave goodbye, march away.</analepsis> Her own sister now
        somewhere around the curve of the earth where day was night, doing her bit, making sure the f‌lyers and tank drivers
        and grunts got their letters from home.

        "I wonder." she said.

        "So do I."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Resistance Begins">
        "No, I won't support a war if it comes to that," Veronica was saying. "And I don't agree with my sister's decision to
        go, but I respect it because I respect her."

        "That's naive at best," the man leaning on the refrigerator told her. She thought his name was Myron something and
        he seemed to be a friend of her ex-roommate Holly, but who could be sure? "The war machine is a universal fact of
        existence in the so-called modern world," Myron Something held forth. "We're all implicated, so by their own
        totalizing logic, we're also all empowered. To subvert the motherfuckers."

        "Bean dip," Veronica remembered. "I knew I came in here for something."

        "Opposition to war is everyone's responsibility," Myron persisted, "on a personal as well as a political level.
        Resistance begins at home."
    </div>

    <div title="Polemicist">
        <prolepsis>At this point the air was cleft by a mighty eruption — "YOOAAUUURREthpt, es-KEWS me, ladies" — heralding the
        arrival of Billy Van Saxgutter, horn arranger and main polemicist for the cowboy-funk group Boogie/Dogey.

        "Bean dip," Veronica repeated. "Where's that bean dip."

        Billy Van, whose notoriety in the alternative press owed to his uncanny resemblance to the young LBJ, cranked back
        his Stetson and scratched along his imaginary gall bladder scar. "Beg pard'n, stranger," he said to Myron
        Something, "but did Ah heer yew say'n sumpin maht be constrew'd as DIS-loil t'ahr brave men 'n' wimmen in the
        Gulf?"

        Myron was, frankly, agoggle. "Oh wow," he marveled. "Oh fucking wow. The god of the fascists, live and in
        person." He wanted to reach out and touch the squinting apparition, but was afraid it might bite.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Exchange of Views">
        <prolepsis>"Hey now," Veronica enjoined, "can we, everybody, like take a little pledge not to even think about the middle east
        while we're partying here, all right?"

        But it was way too late for this kind of thinking.

        Myron gave Billy Van a measured and provocative stare. "I think," he delivered, "that this war scare bullshit is
        nothing but a reactionary conspiracy to divert the people's attention from the wholesale disenfranchisement of the
        American working class." <fid>Uh huh.</fid>

        Billy Van tightened his squint while he cogitated, sizing up the situation. At six-three and 205, Billy Van had a
        fundamental problem relating to lesser specimens like this Myron. Instinct told him to just stomp on the little
        pissant, but <analepsis>lately he'd begun to recognize that this strategy could be counterproductive,</analepsis> especially when the night
        was still young.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Conflict Management">
        <prolepsis>It took some close consideration, but eventually Billy Van Saxgutter decided not to punch out Myron Something's
        lights. He opted instead for another familiar behavior from his rich cultural repertoire.

        Hands f‌irmly on his Don't-Tread-On-Me belt buckle, Billy Van broke into a large, predacious grin. In spite of himself,
        Myron Something blanched. It was one of those moves that put you in mind of sixguns and f‌lying lead.

        But come on, this was the New World Order here. Billy Van took a quick step to the lef‌t, did something fast with his
        hands, spun around, squatted, and announced:

        "Hey peckerwood, yew kin jes' kiss mah Yeller Rose."

        Veronica meanwhile seemed to have come upon a new mantra. "Bean dip," she chanted on her way out of the
        kitchen. "Bean dip, bean dip."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Public Opinion">
        <prolepsis>By now the rumblings from halfway round the world had grown into an unavoidable topic of conversation. Veronica
        kept running up against it.

        "End of the world as we know it," a white boy in dreadlocks was saying in the living room. "Saddam lets all that shit
        loose in the oilf‌ields, you won't be able to stand downwind for a couple decades. How's that for an energy policy?"
        Veronica started to say something but reeled off into futility.

        "Fuck that protest scene," a restless drummer declared in the back bedroom. His group was going through a
        court-ordered disbandment and he was kind of stressed. "If you ask me, a nice little war is just what this fucking
        town needs. Give it a crash dose of reality, shock some sense into these slackers." Veronica found the bean dip at
        the drummer’s feet and spent an interesting minute or two slathering it over his facial parts.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Ghost">
        <prolepsis>Veronica was just beginning not to enjoy herself in earnest but you know how these evenings go. Just when you
        think you’ve touched bottom, somebody moves the f‌loor. This time the blame belonged to Victor Gardner, who
        swooped in behind Veronica as she was checking the tequila situation on the front porch. He was precociously
        drunk.

        "Emily," he pleaded sliding his hands around her small waist.

        "Close but wrong hemisphere," she informed him.

        "Sorry," Victor muttered. "Thought I felt a ghost."

        She turned and pinned him with a furious glare. There weren't words for what she was feeling.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Emily to Thea">
        12—20—90
        Somewhere in S.A.

        Thea Dear,

        Hiya, how you, what's the weather like back in Tara, cold enough for ya, bla
        bla, why dont you write me? Am I pissed? (figurativley speaking of course,
        tho we did manage to score some | interesting | camel juice last week from
        the transport jockeys, what a war) Yes I A*M pissed cause here it is going
        on two months I've been in this armpit of the byond and what do I hear from
        my best friend and thesis advisor? (note order) Diddly F. Shit is what.
        For shame.

        I mean there you are Professor of Rehtoric and you can't get it together to
        write so much as a Hope your having fun, We're behind you all the way, Give
        peace a chance, Check out this shit, Dear John, whatever.

        Where's my goddam letter?
    </div>

    <div title="My Fault?">
        Why the silence, boss? Could it be you can't get your head around this
        little wargame of ours? It is a trip most defintely, as my mom might say.
        Though there'd be a weird—out for sure, Lucy Sunshine over here in
        Saudiland. She'd probably figure it was the end of the world live and in
        person, no waiting. Sometimes it sure do look that way.

        Anyway, I happen to know that I'm getting my mail good and reglar just like
        the Man wants us to: I'm in the business, after all. Boris writes me six or
        seven times a day, thats a story all by itself. So it isn't like your
        letters have got misrouted to Bagdad or something. Did I do something to
        offend your sensibilties? What is it, you think just because I'm in the
        Reserves that I'm somehow responsible for the policy that got me sent here?
    </div>

    <div title="Poor Correspondent">
        Thea looked away. "I haven't written."

        "I know. Why not?"

        She breathed out a big wreath of smoke and watched it curl around the light f‌ixtures. "For all sorts of bad reasons,
        Boris. Denial. Fear. Anger."

        Urquhart f‌ingered the envelope. "She loves you."

        Thea glared at him. "I know that. Shut up." They passed into a momentary sour silence. "How about you?"

        "I'm all right. I miss her terribly."

        She gave him a most penetrating look. "Poor Boris."
    </div>

    <div title="1990 Facts">
        While History often surprises, it very seldom features forgiveness. <analepsis>The turn of events that saved young Boris from
        the jungle did not put paid to his mortal obligations; they were simply converted and postponed.</analepsis>

        Fifteen years further along, Boris Urquhart met a student of anthropology by the name of Emily Runbird, with whom
        he fell stone in love. Imagine History, weird old pervert, perched on the bedstead with an unhealthy grin on its
        ancient face. The Wheel was coming round.

       <analepsis>Like many graduate students in that part of the world, Emily had made certain commitments to her Uncle to f‌inance
        the work on her degree.</analepsis> In September of 1990, Uncle sent a letter calling in the chit.
    </div>

    <div title="Frenzy">
        Urquhart stepped into the light again and it was like walking back through the doors of an asylum.

        Hi there! Welcome once more to the world of the mad, we're so glad to see you again!
        Meanwhile in the Persian Gulf...

        A babble of voices washed over him, reporting, summarizing, intoning, chanting. All those many voices saying over
        and over again the same things. All those voices...

        In the living room, deep in the heart of it all, sat Miles Macarthur. He was clearly engaged in some kind of feeding
        frenzy.
    </div>

    <div title="Feed">
        <prolepsis>Macarthur had TV's set up along three compass bearings (Urquhart's color set, plus the old black-and-white from the
        guestroom and his own Watchman). The VCR was active, taping away. He'd tuned the stereo to an all-news AM
        station in New Orleans with the volume down to a murmur. The fax machine in the study was churning of‌f a
        dispatch and the printer on Urquhart's PC was cycling. Macarthur had his own laptop jacked in to the phoneline and
        seemed to be splitting his primary attention between Compuserve and CNN.

        "Interesting?" Urquhart asked.

        "Not yet."

        Urquhart noted that the microwave was running with nothing inside. Macarthur apologized. "I got a little
        confused."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Update">
        <prolepsis>"So, where are we at the moment?"

        "We're bombing the bejeez out of Baghdad. A thousand sorties."

        "I'm not taking this in."

        "They called an air raid for Riyadh but the all-clear just sounded."

        "Riyadh, as in Saudi Arabia."

        "Rumors of multiple SLCM impacts on the Iraqi Ministry of Information."

        "Do I need to know this."

        "Cheney just said we'll never stop bombing."

        "Shit."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Sitrep">
        <prolepsis>"And what's the national mood like?"

        Macarthur thought for a second. "We could say 'edgy' and not be too inaccurate."

        "Paralyzed? Terrorized? Resolute? Euphoric? Unbelieving?"

        "It depends on your frame of reference. I'll put it this way, I just saw footage from Times Square. They got Con Ed
        in the street welding the fuckin' manholes shut."

        "Serious."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Apocalypso">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart watched Macarthur taking it all in, making the rounds of his hookups and keeping careful notes. The man's
        obsession was familiar, almost comforting in a way. Urquhart could understand this need to see what could be seen,
        to seek out the litanies of speculation and terror. He recalled <analepsis>other crises, all those dangerous intersections of recent
        years — Chernobyl, the Challenger f‌ireworks, the Pentagon's little screentests in Grenada and Panama.

        Each time, a few minutes into the present danger, there'd be Macarthur on the line from New York, L.A., or the desert,
        talking in that vague tone that said all our operators are busy but passing on the updates nice and steady.</analepsis>

        There was a fellowship in this, as there would have been for any metropolitan American of a certain age. The
        inevitable ef‌fect of <analepsis>a history given to sudden ruptures, a history of missiles, cracked reactor vessels, and guns in the
        street.</analepsis> Both men had that nasty taste for apocalypse. <analepsis>They'd grown up inside the same nightmares.</analepsis></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Dream">
        <analepsis>Urquhart and Macarthur had both made many visits to the Dream of the Auditorium.</analepsis>

        Maybe you've had this one too. It begins with the streets at dusk — your streets, the ones you know best, the one
        where you live. A man in white clothes is driving a white car slowly through those streets. [In both our subjects'
        accounts it is actually a Good Humor truck.]

        At f‌irst you can hear the music from the truck, and maybe you remember how just those f‌irst few distant notes used
        to start you racing for the door. Or even, uh, salivating. But now as the truck comes closer it is, curiously enough,
        getting harder to hear the music. Or maybe it’s harder to recognize what you hear as music.

        That’s because it isn't music anymore but speech. The man in the truck is saying something, calling out, making
        some kind of announcement. You can hear every word but you can't understand.
    </div>

    <div title="Gathering">
       <prolepsis>Though you never comprehend the words, you come to know somehow that the P.A. announcement is an
        instruction to gather. All the families must gather up what belongs to them and join an orderly procession headed
        down the street or up the hill or over the bridge or across the river to the gathering place. There they must go into
        the auditorium and take their appointed seats, where they will wait for the dream to be over.

        But the dreamer, who almost invariably sees him or herself as a child, cannot join the people in the procession.

        Something has been forgotten — a friend, a sister or brother, a household pet or totem object. Something has been
        left behind.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Return">
        <prolepsis>The dreamer goes in search of this lost person or object.

        The dreamer searches low and high, running through all the lifeless streets. When the object is found (often it isn't
        really found, or it is found under some absurd transformation) the dreamer returns to the doors of the gathering
        place, but the doors are locked or they are barred by a polite off‌icial. This person, who for both Macarthur and
        Urquhart is always Richard Milhous Nixon, will not let the dreamer take in that which has been left behind.

        Like everyone else who has this dream, Urquhart and Macarthur know perfectly well what it is about.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Reassurance">
        "Thing of the past," Urquhart reassured Macarthur.

        "Couldn't happen these days," Macarthur concurred, "not with your New World Order."

        "Quite."

        Both men were silent, watching the screens strobe, listening to the broadcast babble, thinking about what might be
        passing through the air, the skies.

        "Still," Macarthur allowed, "I can see how you'd be upset. I'm sorry if I've upset you."

        "Yes," Urquhart said a little absently. "Right, yes. Thanks."
    </div>

    <div title="Grounded">
        But we have forsaken this god.

        Today the President says the Bird f‌lies no more. <analepsis>Frightened by the prospect of a fully-armed Russia stumbling into
        anarchy, Bush and the brinksmen have f‌inally taken a real step back. SAC has been ordered to stand down from
        nuclear alert.</analepsis> At last, against all cynical odds, the Cold War may be f‌inished.

        To any survivor of the period, this has got to be wonderful news. Much less worrying about the f‌ingers on the
        triggers, about your distance from ground zero, about the f‌lash in the night. We can wind back the doomsday clock.
        But there's also something troubling in this sunshine scenario, even something dangerous. There is a danger of
        forgetfulness, a danger of ignorance.

        Madness should always be remembered.

    <div title="Meet Again">
        Re-ligio is a tying-back, a link to what was before... cultus, a turning-over of memory's soil. In a time when God
        remains a trope, worship is history. Judge then the wholeness of a people by the soundness of their faith. Faith is
        memory.

        Shall we order up a New World (again, Columbus)? Do we go Back to the Future? Will we circumvent the past with
        a fancy end-around?

        Desecration. Impiety. Sacrilege.

        If we would keep faith with the Great Bird, we will not let her fade away in windswept desert salvage f‌ields. If we are
        wise, we will designate the forty surviving aircraft as National Museum of Apocalypse, each plane to be adorned
        with folk-art and graf‌itti and billeted, with her live bomb load, in a plexiglass hangar at a major metropolitan airport.

        "You have to believe, you've gotta have faith," Thea pointed out. "This isn't going to be any television war, sister.
        It‘s not what you see that matters, but what you won't see. Press restrictions, pool coverage, censorship."

        "Guess we'll have to wait for the movies this time around."

        Thea shuff‌led the channels, ended up in a teaser for the local news at ten. Promise of coverage from "Tara's own
        Randy Wozzeck in the Gulf."

        "Where are you tonight, Clint Eastwood?" She stared at the CBS "War in the Gulf" logo running through its
        animations. The more she watched, the more clearly she understood what she had to do next. She got to her feet.
        "See no evil," Thea said.

    <div title="Face the Wall">
        <prolepsis>Thea turned the TV to the wall, watching the auroras of living color that leaked from the edges of the tube and
        played across the wallpaper. She felt hollow, disconnected, almost viscerally shocked. She wanted another
        cigarette and she needed a drink.

        Veronica stared at the back of the set. "Fuck." Dan Rather was saying something sanctimonious about Who
        Started This. Thea wanted to scream, but there it was. January 16.

        American planes, no one knew how many, were playing tag-team mayhem over downtown Baghdad, just as <analepsis>the men
        in blue had threatened some weeks back.</analepsis> America was gone to war. There were a half million citizens caught up in
        it somehow, somewhere.

        One of them was Emily, and neither woman could stop thinking of her.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Keep the Change">
        <prolepsis>Veronica got up to switch off the lights and they sat looking down the canyon at all the houses in the West Hills,
        blue video traces in every other window. The coals of their cigarettes glowed and wavered.

        Sam Donaldson was talking about the level of activity at the White House. He seemed more than usually sardonic,
        and Thea had the crazy idea that he must be amused, talking into a blank wall.

        "I like it better that way," Veronica noted, gesturing with her cigarette at the reversed TV.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Sisters">
        <prolepsis>Thea studied Veronica's face in the f‌lare of a long drag. There was concern in her face tonight, along with what
        looked like raw weariness — as if, this early on, she'd already been in some tight scrape. The resemblance to Emily
        was vivid: the same high cheekbones and long, stepped nose, the ash-blonde complexion a shade more delicate in
        the younger sister. Emily was the slender, elegant one driven crazy by endless comparisons to La Streep. Veronica's
        looks were less easily put down to type, a touch androgynous like a femme Lennon, especially in these granny
        glasses she'd taken to wearing.

        She was somewhere in her early twenties: straight, tall, strong, wide in the hips but oddly girlish in her moves, given
        to compulsive awkwardness as if she were trying to keep her real grace under wraps.

        Sometimes, Thea ref‌lected, looking at Veronica was like watching a projection of herself reeled back from twenty-f‌ive
        years past.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Generations">
        <prolepsis>"You managed to grow up without a war," Thea observed. "I keep forgetting."

        Veronica stubbed out her cigarette. "Almost."

        "Shit." She went over to the television, turned it a few degrees experimentally, saw still more of the same, turned it
        back.

        "Does anything ever change?" Veronica wanted to know.

        "Not if they can help it."

        "That‘s what I thought you'd say."</prolepsis>

    <div title="P.C.">
        The articles of our faith are comprised in the Perpetuating Contract, the document negotiated between Jehovah Lord
        of Hosts and Andrew Carnegie of Hellshaft, Pennsylvania at the dawn of time, or was it the American Century,
        comes to the same thing.

        The Contract specif‌ies a monetary standard for all acts of signif‌ication.
        The Contract assures that the Ball Shall Continue Bouncing.
        The Contract stipulates that bigger is necessarily better.
        The Contract establishes Unrestricted Growth as a natural right of all enterprises.
        The Contract decrees that the rich are not like you and him.
        The Contract redef‌ines the wages of sin.
        The Contract promises every sucker an even break.
        The Contract guarantees liberal injustice for all.
        The Contract says not to worry, we'll think of something.
    </div>

    <div title="Except...">
        Now under the shining Eye of the Contract, the condition of Mankind (by which of course we mean...) was indeed
        blessed and seemed like to continue so in perpetuity.

        EXCEPT THAT the spirit of the Sarpint, that mother of duplicities who ever speaks with forked tongue, looked
        upon the Contract and grew spiteful of its elegant simplicity and its incompatibility with Thermodynamics, the God
        of all Sarpints.

        So being swollen great with wrath, this caviler and theorist came down into Europe and expelled from her nether
        parts a devil in the shape of a man, which devil she named (in a f‌it of depraved irony) Herr Marx, which is to say
        Mister Banknotes. And she f‌illed the head of this devil with false seemings, the which he published in an
        exceedingly ironical book called Kapital, a name which in its proper sense is Holinesse.
    </div>

    <div title="You Say You Vanna">
        Now this Mister Banknotes went forth from Europe spreading the counterfeit gospel of "Revolution," in which we
        may detect yet a third irony foisted upon us by the Sarpint.

        For until the heretic passed off his baseless coinage, that word appertained only to the Wheel of Fortune, sublime
        appliance of the goddess Vanna Serutan whose regular circulation provides the steady rise and fall which is the very
        Peristalsis of Commerce.

        The Sarpint's henchman and his followers alienated Revolution from its true and proper context, promulgating a vile
        distortion that struck at the heart of the holy Contract. They falsely taught that History is not an eternally cycling
        Wheel but a linear march or Struggle whose steps are bent (they claimed) toward a People's Utopia — though as we
        know better, it is in fact a serpentine track winding down into Prof‌itless Chaos.
    </div>

    <div title="Millenial">
        Infected by this heretical contagion, the body politic of Europe underwent dire convulsions. The fever was so great
        that it temporarily addled the Great Powers, causing Free governments (by which we mean...) to be replaced by
        Power-Mad Dictators whose grandiose visions of personal authority f‌louted the Contract itself.

        A long and terrible war ensued in which the upheavals were so horrendous that they forced the defenders of the
        Contract to bring forth the Ultimate Weapon, an engine that threatened to abrogate the Contract and offer the
        human race in sacrif‌ice to — —.

        In the face of this unthinkable threat a modicum of sanity returned to the Powers, but the poisonous doctrines of the
        Sarpint remained abroad in the world. There followed a long and taxing Cold War in which the Evil Empire did their
        worst to oppose, subvert, and undermine those still faithful to the Contract. But at length, as the f‌irst light of the
        Millenium crept upon the world, the Evil Empire crumbled from within and a New World Order came into View.
    </div>

    <div title="Political Correction">
        But this New Order could be secured only if the old ways of error, deceit, and sarpintry were f‌irst expunged from the
        earth.

        The Cold War and its resulting Inf‌lation had left the good people of the world (by which we mean...) uncertain and
        conf‌used. Many apparently upstanding individuals were eaten away inwardly by doubt and hereditary
        deconstruction.

        The New Order could defeat the Revolution only if a champion could be found, a Good King to lead the people
        through a great Course Correction, a grand reversal that would lead them back within the domain of Fortune's Wheel.

        So favored were the people (by which we mean...) that they found their champion in the person of the Regainer, the
        Prince of the Morning who brought the light back to America.
    </div>

    <div title="Back to the Future">
        But the great Return was left unf‌inished, and so at the start of that fateful year of the mirror, 1991, America set out
        once again on the tortuous path of warfare. Once again an Expedition was sent around the world, this time swift and
        resolute and unconstrained.

        Their purpose, it was said, was to preserve the peace, but we knew in our hearts that their crusade had a higher
        purpose: to defend and secure the American way of life, to perpetuate the Contract and bring us back a future.

        In some cases Return is simply impossible; this too is part of the American story.

        Nixon, for instance. The man lies beyond recovery, as each pathetically abortive comeback further demonstrates.
        It's a matter of destiny. Nixon can't ever return to the bosom because he has lived through his own apotheosis, the
        moment when fate created him National Dick or the Lightkeeper. We will always need him up there in his dark tower
        with a permanent view of the shoals. We will always need him. One day soon he will give up the ghost but that
        won't really matter because of the advance of technology.

        What are the shoals? What danger did we put the Tower there to mark?

        "He's doing f‌ine, it was great." But his tone was full of impatience. "Listen, if it's all right with you, I'd rather talk
        politics."</prolepsis>

    <div title="What Should I Do?">
        <prolepsis>"If there really is a war," Leroy proposed, "what should I do?"

        Thea gave him an odd look. <fid>What kind of question was that?</fid> "Well, you can't vote for another twenty-eight
        months. Also there's no draft. Doesn't that pretty much limit your direct involvement? Count yourself lucky, is
        what you can do."

        Leroy stared at her. "Is that what you would have done when you were my age?"

        She thought about it. "Touche."

        <fid>Child of surprises, and they just kept coming. Fifteen-and-a-half, pushing twenty-one.</fid> She reconsidered, swapped
        scripts. "Okay, what can you do, Mister Activist. You can start by acting your conscience and speaking your
        mind."

        Leroy scowled. "Yeah."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Old Movies">
        <prolepsis>Leroy rolled his eyes. "But my mind's real confused, Mom. You and Dad never have trouble with politics. You
        know where you stand — it all goes back to that big decade of yours. Your sixties. But it's not so easy for a kid
        right now."

        She studied him in plain astonishment. <fid>Where did all this soul-searching come from? Wasn't he supposed to be
        self-contained and arrogant and degree-zero cynical? Didn't he watch The Simpsons? Such an improbable boy.</fid>
        "Jeez, I feel so ignorant," Leroy went on. "When you say 'war' all I can think of is old movies. Star Wars and
        Platoon and Heartbreak Hill.."

        <fid>Yes, yes,</fid> she thought, <fid>old movies. Five, ten, f‌ifteen years, practically his whole lifetime. Old movies. All Quiet on
        the Western Front. Sands of Iwo Jima. Bedtime for Bonzo.</fid></prolepsis>

        Down at The Saloon of Tomorrow (more widely known, for reasons best kept obscure, as the Just Say No Cafe), the
        mood was subdued. Here it was just past nine on a Thursday, and not just any old Thursday but either an
        Apocalypse Soon Open Mike Nite or a Stairway to Heaven Hoot Nite (cash prizes for the least recognizable
        rendition) depending on which of two barely legible chalkboards you regarded as authoritative, assuming you still
        wanted anything to do with a concept like authority in this day and age, ack.

    <div title="No Music">
        <prolepsis>Veronica stalled with one foot over the threshold, causing Haney to bump against her shoulderblades. Something
        wasn't right here. It rolled right up and hit her in the face.

        "No music?" Haney noticed, a beat late.

        Absence is presence. There was not a trace of melody in the No tonight, there was not even a snatch of rhythm
        from some gigless drummer working out a solo on the side of his beer glass. Everybody at the bar seemed stuck in
        some kind of f‌it, staring up through gathering webs of passive smoke at the common screen.

        "The threat of chemical attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia," Tom Brokaw greeted them.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Pass It On">
        <prolepsis>"..looks like we've lost our transmission from Bernie Shaw and Peter Arnett in Baghdad, but this was to be

        Somebody pressed something cold into Harley's hand and with a pubcrawler’s ref‌lex he brought it up to his month.
        only to discover that he was standing there with a remote control unit pressed to his lips.

        A fellow in a Ziggy Marley T-shirt and wingtips gave him a tolerant look. "Click when you feel like it, then pass it
        on." Harley shut his eyes and pushed a button.

        "... if you'd like to put your gas mask on now, we'll understand," Peter Jennings was saying. "It's your call, as
        always."

        Harley passed it on.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Fog">
        <prolepsis>This was just about the moment when the Fog closed in on Harley. The Fog, you might remember, was on most
        journalistic lips in those days. As in: "Of course Dan these projections are all well and good, but we must keep in
        mind what strategists call 'the Fog of War.'"

        You may have visualized a bank of white smoke washing over a bunch of doomed extras marching into the
        grapeshot while the General Staff pace around their tent trying to f‌igure out how to make impotence look like injured
        dignity. But that's the movies. Maybe it occurred to you that this Thursday night we weren't at the movies.

        And if like Veronica Runbird you happened to have a sibling somewhere in the Gulf, then maybe when they said
        fog you thought gas and immediately tried to think of something else.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Lost">
        <prolepsis>Harley reached down for Veronica's hand but came up empty. The No was suddenly very crowded. The regular
        grad student crowd had arrived in force and now they were joined by a steady stream of passersby pressing in from
        the street to make up some sort of quorom for the crisis.

        Harley dodged in and out, trying to f‌ight the tidal surge toward the bar and its shining eye. He ended up curbside
        on East Main, breathless and a little strung out from the press of all those sweating bodies and the whirl of tense
        white faces.

        He looked around but found no trace of her.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Look Out...">
        <prolepsis>Harley sat on the fender of somebody's Jeep and waited for his heart to stop bouncing off his ribcage. He was
        wondering if he should make another foray into the No or just hang out here until Veronica found her way to the
        door. That was assuming that she'd even try to find the door, which he had to admit was unlikely. Like most of the
        reporters he knew, Harley found crowds scary; <analepsis>he'd seen what they could get up to.</analepsis> Veronica, on the other hand,
        seemed perfectly in her element with the bodies per square foot up around 2.5. It was yet another of those sharp
        contrasts in their relationship.

        Harley had just about sorted all this out and was beginning to breathe easy again, when all of a sudden his heart
        went tearing up into his throat. Some idiot cut around the corner of Sangre de Cristo and East Main at about 45,
        stomped the brakes screechingly, and shuddered to a smoky halt just about where Harley was sitting.

        He almost didn't want to look.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Don't Look">
        <prolepsis>Then he looked and wished he hadn't. The vehicle that had just made such a radical arrival in front of the Just Say
        No was a three-year—old silver Porsche very much like the one on which Harley had just made the last payment.
        Coincidence, he told himself. Horrible coincidence. Then just out of morbid curiosity he checked the plates. Sure
        enough there was that Georgia peach and his very own vanity tag "CNNOEVL."

        Harley wanted to scream. The driver of the Porsche leaned out to look behind him and Harley jumped at the
        miserable bastard with murder in his heart...

        Only to pull up short when the f‌igure behind the wheel turned and met his gaze.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Who's This Now?">
        Strictly speaking it was not eye contact, since the abductor of Harley's Porsche was wearing what looked like
        enormously expensive aviator shades. He also had on some kind of military drag — desert fatigues, black beret,
        touches here and there of gold braid. The ID strip on his breast pocket read "UQBARI." Harley took in the dimple
        in the big chin, the ladykiller moustache, the big gold signet ring on the left hand. His head spun.

        "Get in," Urquhart urged. His voice had taken on a tone Harley had never heard before.

        Harley stood staring. <fid>Why my car,</fid> he was wondering.

        "Hurry up," Urquhart insisted. "They're probably right behind me."
    </div>

    <div title="Visitor">
        <analepsis><fid>Do something.</fid>

        Without thinking, Urquhart opened the f‌irst door he came to and walked through. An interesting choice. This was
        the door leading to the garage. He closed the door behind him. Click.

        <fid>Why did I choose this door? U didn't. But here U are.
        I came in here because I have to do something. Well, one of us does.

        Garage.</fid> He f‌licked on the light and looked. Veronica had taken Emily's car; but here was Harley's Porsche. Here was
        Harley's Porsche with the keys in the ignition.

        <fid>Take the car. Move through the night. See what U can do.</fid>

        Someone rapped on the garage window.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Face to Face">
        <prolepsis>At f‌irst Urquhart didn't register the sound. He stood where he was, eyeing the keys in Harley's ignition with
        felonious intent. He reached his special black beret down from its nail, f‌ished out his shades and slid them on.
        <fid>What was he waiting for?</fid>

        The rapper at the window repeated himself, this time using the seal of a heavy class ring. "Hello."

        Urquhart turned with a start, then blinked hard. For a second he thought he was looking at a TV screen — the blunt,
        horsey face, the thick forelock, the slight squint to the eyes staring in at him. Madden.

        And then it came back to him, he'd been through this trick of the eye before. It was the other one, Harley's old
        colleague, Madden the Fed.

        Urquhart walked over to the window and peered out. Madden raised an eyebrow.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Open Up">
        "Dr. Urquhart?" Madden asked, holding his badge against the window pane. Urquhart stared back, unmoving. "I
        need to talk to you. Can you give me a couple minutes?"

        Urquhart tried hard to focus. He was having trouble focusing. Nothing would hold together. <fid>Get out and go.
        Really now, focus. The Federal government had sent a well-known TV personality to spy on him. No, an illusion. It
        was only television. Flashes of light. Stand by, hold on... My mind, Emily, my mind isn't right. Worlds collide.
        Tlon, Uqbar, and the Third One. One of us has to do something.

        Do something.</fid> Urquhart nodded, feeling it start the way it always did with the numbness in his f‌ingers and toes, the
        sudden twitch in his eyeballs, the prickling and goosef‌lesh.... Something slipped, slid. <fid>Where am I? Here I am — no
        over there — over here. Swarming.</fid>

        Watching closely, Madden saw his opening and made good on it.

    <div title="Wise">
        Jude Busch was wise to all sorts of local jive. After six and a half undergraduate years at the University of Tara she
        had picked up a few inside moves. For instance, when dealing with the more erratic members of the faculty,
        especially in Mathematics, Computer Science, or lord help us Virtual Studies, you had to remember the old
        day-for-night play. Come by during the of‌ficial oracle hours and you'd f‌ind the lights on okay, but most likely
        behind a locked door with a suspiciously washed-out note taped to it saying something like, "Gone for Cof‌fee,"
        "Emergency Research in Progress," "Back in [illegible]," sometimes all of the above.

        If you really had to get into the Presence, what you did was show up in the dead of night. Often as not you'd f‌ind
        the lights off and no one apparently home, but if you just knocked f‌irmly while uttering the magic words Campus
        Police, why it was as good as a skeleton key.

        Worked this time anyway.
    </div>

    <div title="Audience">
        <prolepsis>"Wha?" said Urquhart, cracking the door.

        Jude snapped of‌f the f‌lashlight she'd been shining in his face. "Sorry about that, Dr. U. I just thought we could chat
        about seminar if you've got an hour or two." With some of her professors she'd have stuck her foot in the door, but
        Jude didn't f‌igure Urquhart for a hard case.

        "Do I know you?"
        "You direct my special research," she told him.

        Urquhart mulled this over. "Well then. Come sit. Talk. I was just thinking." He went back inside, leaving the door
        ajar, and dropped into his swivel chair by the window. He did not turn on the lights. As her eyes adjusted Jude saw
        that he was staring out the window, gazing down f‌rom the Tower along the broad plaza that led f‌rom the campus to
        the steps of the Capitol.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Some Scene">
        <prolepsis>They sat in silence for two or three minutes, Urquhart continuing to stare and think. Jude had been through this drill
        before and was not deterred. She sat chin-in-hand, studying the back of his head, sending out waves of
        determination. Finally Urquhart changed tactics, of‌fering her a cheroot if she wanted. "They're in the drawer. And
        you might light one for me while you're at it." <fid>Aha, the old I'm-a-sexist-pig ploy.</fid> But Jude was wise to this, too.

        She found the cigars in the desk drawer under a heap of circuit cards and what looked like an empty pistol clip.
        Academics, you never could tell. She trimmed the cigars, got them started and passed one to Urquhart, who took it
        without turning around.

        "That was some scene last Friday at Veronica Runbird's party," Jude remarked.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not I">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart vented smoke. "Scene?" he said. Lamely.

        "You remember," Jude replied. "The game with the speech and the pistol and the impersonation of you-know-who.
        How'd you manage to disappear so quick? I thought the cops would get you for sure."

        "That wasn't me," he protested. He reached back to knock some ash from his cigar onto the papers on his desk.

        Jude delved into the desk drawer again and came up with a natty cashmere beret of familiar cut. "Well what's this
        then." She settled the beret over her shock of black hair.

        "Wasn't me," he insisted. "It must have been someone else—"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="How U?">
        <prolepsis>"Someone else... in your body?" Jude asked.

        "Something like that."

        She propped a foot on one of Urquhart's bookshelves and tilted back the uncomfortable off‌ice chair. "Feeling okay
        these days, Dr. U.?"

        "How nice of you to ask." Urquhart studied his cigar critically. "Just for the sake of inquiry, do I really know you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Speaking of Which...">
        <prolepsis>"Jude Busch. I took your Artif‌icial Paranoia course in '87, sat through half of your Postmodern Delusions in '89,
        switched my major from philosophy and got an A from you in Interactive Aesthetics last fall. You gave special
        pennission to let me into 8088 this term."

        "I did?"

        "Sort of. You really did want to sign that letter, believe me."

        "Ah."

        "Speaking of which, we've been missing you in seminar."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="How Things Are">
        <prolepsis>"Sorry about seminar," Urquhart apologized. "You know how these things are."

        Jude tapped her cheroot against the edge of the wastebasket. "No, I don't know. I don't even know what things
        we're talking about, much less how they are."

        "Oh." Silence ensued.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Some Kind of Crisis">
        <prolepsis>Jude swung her chair back to the level, got up and leaned against the far edge of the desk. "You really can trust me,
        Dr. U. I'm kind of like family with the Runbirds. Veronica and I went to school together back in Eustace and I've
        known Emily since I f‌irst came to town. She's the one who talked me into taking your classes. She's a good friend of
        mine and I know you care about her. That makes me want to help."

        She picked at a letter lying midway down in the desktop detritus. It was half dissolved with f‌ive or six other pieces
        of paper into some kind of gummy mass.

        "Are we looking at a mid-life crisis here, Dr. U.?"

        Urquhart weighed the possibility. "Crisis yes. I have certain problems with the modif‌ier."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Ourselves">
        <prolepsis>"We haven't been ourselves lately," Urquhart tried to explain. "Or rather, we have." Jude wasn't following. Maybe
        it was the contradictions.

        "What it is," he tried again, "is this swarming sensation, you see." He turned his chair back into the room and
        looked vaguely in her direction, momentarily blinded by the change of light.

        "Swarming sensation? Maybe it's just, like, your inner ear," Jude suggested.

        Urquhart laughed. "You could say that." He went quiet again, listening with that inner ear. The nub of his cigar
        glowed steadily. "U. likes to think of himself as a crossover," he continued at last, "as much humanist as scientist.
        So for the last ten years or so he's been sucking up that postmodern theory. This may have been the beginning."

        "Fair guess," Jude opined.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Theory of My Life">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart breathed out a screen of smoke. "He's been reading all about ef‌facement of the subject, about the self as a
        scene of inscription, a writing space, society of mind. Hello Auntie Oedipus, meet Mister Moving Dif‌ference." He
        trimmed his cigar blindly into what he thought was an ashtray. "He's been through it all, for what it was worth,
        which in his humble opinion ain't real much. The Japanese, for whom U. has great respect, have a good description
        for this kind of thinking. 'Table theory,' they call it. Blowing in the wind." He put his tongue between his lips and
        illustrated.

        "Refreshing to hear you say that," Jude told him.

        "But then one day," he continued, "U. saw the light. What was table theory turned suddenly into his life story. It
        came to him quite graphically. U. had a look in the mirror and there they was. All sorts of him, shimmering,
        swarming. All at once, manyness."

        "Groovy."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Multiplier Effect">
        <prolepsis>Jude turned his words over a few times in her head. "Is this like a Shirley Maclaine-Dianetics thing?" she asked.
        "Past lives, reincamations, like that?"

        "Not at all," he told her. "More like a case of multiple personalities."

        "Oh, that." As if he'd said warts, heartburn, athlete's foot.

        "You don't understand," Urquhart objected. "I keep slipping out of myself. I keep turning into someone else."

        "Don't you just hate when that happens."

        Urquhart looked at her skeptically. "You don't seem to take this problem seriously. Young shithead."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="The Seventies">
        <prolepsis>Jude laughed in a way she meant as friendly. "I'm sorry, Dr. U. Really, no offense. So you're having a little trouble
        holding yourself together these days. It happens. What was it, too much Liquid Sunshine back in the sixties?"

        "It was the seventies," he pointed out, "and back then I wasn't having any. I was an abstaining geek." He gave it
        some thought. "Maybe that's the problem."

        Jude traced some stylized paisleys with her cigar end. "Vitamin Acid never did me all that much good," she
        ref‌lected. "But maybe you're right. If you'd done some tripping, maybe you wouldn't be so concerned about what’s
        going on in your head now."

        "I'm losing my sanity, Jude."

        "Oh, that." As if he'd said he was losing his hair.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Trembling on the Brink">
        <prolepsis>"Here I am having a mental breakdown and what happens, I get students dropping by in the middle of the night to
        tell me don't worry, be happy."

        Jude blew smoke at him. "You're having a breakdown."

        "Fucking right. Here comes the blessed break, all aboard that night train going round the bend. Check your street
        clothes with the attendant, next stop the merry land of Pharmacopeia."

        He'd got her laughing again. "Congratulations," she managed.

        Urquhart stared at her through the standing smoke. "Does this seem amusing to you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="On the Bus">
        <prolepsis>Jude had to wait until the giggles subsided. "I'm sorry. I'm not making fun, really. I know what you're feeling, or at
        least I think I do. It's just that you're being so ridiculous about it."

        "Well gee thanks, Jude."

        "No really. I know all about this swarming sensation of yours. Me, in only 25 years I've been through more selves
        than you could f‌it on a school bus."

        "What do you know about insanity?" Urquhart shook his head.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="What She Knows">
        <prolepsis>Jude looked at him steadily.

        "Oh, enough. Two years, f‌ive months, and three weeks in institutions before I was sixteen," she told him. "And oh
        yes, I was a teenage suicide. Or almost. You might say I made the semif‌inals."

        .

        There was a heavy silence.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Better All The Time">
        <prolepsis>"I'm sorry," Urquhart said softly, crossing his arms over his chest. "I'm sorry for you, Jude."

        She pushed herself off the desk and stretched. "Hey, no point in that, it was a long time ago. I was real fucked up
        but I had some pretty good reasons, which I think I've f‌inally f‌igured out."

        "And now you're all right?"

        Jude laughed sharply when she heard that one. "I don't think so. If it wasn't for this brain conditioner they give me,
        I'd probably go back to seeing little babies crawling on the windowsills. See, I'm what folks would call Crazy."

        She leaned back in and looked him straight in the face. "And it isn't the end of the world. This is what I'm trying to
        tell you."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Distinctions">
        <prolepsis>"You're saying don't f‌ight it, just let it come down?" Urquhart asked.

        "You're telling me there's an option?"

        Urquhart spun his chair back to the window, watching the night breeze from the river scatter some fallen leaf‌lets
        across the plaza. <fid>Enlightenment from a confessed madwoman ten years his junior, well why not? He was having a

        of the late Ayatollah. He'd pinned it to his of‌fice door for a week or so, then moved it inside and taped it over his
        desk. Finally he ran it through the scanner and processed it into a digital background for his virtual desktop. Lately
        when the Old Man's voice rumbled up he could almost see the bushy eyebrows twitch, those taut lips begin to stir.

        You always knew it would look like this.

        An irrational space, a strange hotel, all atrium and concrete pillars with glassine cephalopod elevators crawling up
        down and yes across the walls thrust balconies darting out at all sorts of angles mostly not quite right hanging
        gardens dripping giant fern tendrils six or seven stories down the gravity well — y'know those things are actually
        predatory, gotta keep 'em trimmed back so's they don't snag some hapless conventioneer— while bright little
        hallucinated birds zip and swing through the arcades and conversation pits at the speed of sound and then
        transform into fading word balloons: sping! zippo! doink!

        Here is an Information Kiosk. — Which way to... er... the lobby?

        Ha ha. Always the jokester aren't you. Hang a left then another left, go left again and you'll stumble on it right after

        So you look to your left and across the entire north face of the clif‌f here's this enormous East-bloc-dictator-size
        glossy depicting the 38th Vice President of the United States, Spiro T. "My Kind of Guy" Agnew big schnozz beady
        eyes and all, and strung along beneath it there's this banner festooned with purple and pink bunting and it say:

        WELCOME DELEGATES TO FIRST INTERNATIONAL spiroCON

        You're trying to slot this into your gestalt when some very small person with prominent incisors wearing a black
        plastic mac tugs you by the sleeve and when you f‌inish brushing him off and look back, watchaknow... that sign...
        it's just... GONE!

        You didn't see that; the munchkin says. You look down and notice he's wearing an elaborate rosette name tag. HI
        THERE! Just ca11 me Leonard G. Agnew! You look at your own lapel where there's a similar device blossoming and
        it say AND I'M Miles Q. Agnew, PLEASETAMEETCHA!

        How is it we all have the same name? you think to ask but before you can get your mouth open the leetle feller has
        jetted off in a f‌lurry of helium giggles tee—heeheeheeheehee, etc.

        Boris T. Agnew strolls out onto the balcony just above your head. He is masked with the face of David Letterman,
        or is it Jimmy Carter, or is it Howdy Doody? — Shhhh, Boris says, don't think so loud. Jude S. Agnew moves out of
        the shadows. — They might hear you, she cautions.

        The f‌loor undergoes some kind of paradigm shift and there you are on the balcony with them, admiring the waterfall
        with its colorful salmon ropers.

        —There's something you're not telling me, you observe.

        No! they say.
        Yes! they say.

    <div title="Facemask">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        — Why's the mask, you ask... but there's no time to answer, because... Zrrrrrrrr... what's that!? Why it's a
        subcompact Fuji Blimp bearing down on you like some predatory f‌loating signif‌ier and calling out in a nonhuman
        voice:

        Jude hands you your own mask, which seems to have these enormous teardrop-shaped Whitley Strieber alien eyes
        and... say, what's this ventilator for?

        — Just put it on quick.

    <div title="Cover Story">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        A dense bank of indoor fog seems to have rolled in. Or could it be—

        —None of this is what it seems. Boris tries to explain.

        — Sno wuff a buck in'owick og? you're wondering, somewhat troubled by that mask but reluctant to take it off
        under the circumstances.

        — What's going on is a strategem, a necessary deception, Jude tells you. — The Agnew angle is just a cover.

        The blimp cruises off into the thickening mist. Boris waits until he can no longer hear its engines, then nods brief‌ly.
        — Actually, he whispers, you're attending the Seventeenth International Convention of Conspiracy Theorists.

        — Gno zhit!
    </div>

    <div title="Plots Thicken">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        The fog thickens alarmingly all around you.

        It's becoming so dense that it's actually gone semi-solid in places — no, all over! And all of a sudden it's like you're
        encased in this stuf‌f, as if you're walking through a tank where somebody's been mixing soapsuds and agar jelly for
        a new diet desert and all-purpose cleanser.

        You're a little worried because you can't see the walls or the f‌loor, and weren't you standing on a balcony a minute
        ago, which means

        which means

        that...
    </div>

    <div title="Things Change">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        No, it's all right. In fact you can't feel the f‌loor anymore either. You can't really tell where your feet are, or your
        hands or your arms or...

        Proprioceptive incoherence: often among the earliest warning signs of Burroughs' Irrealis, or as we called it in
        the days before grant money, the Slipping Sickness.

        Is this what they mean by white-out, you're wondering, when a voice reaches you saying: Pssst, hey meester, over
        here!

        — Ha ha, you say, that's a nice one: where's here? Sounds fading up now of a Really Big lever being swung over
        and this is where the zones change over with the thunderous snick of a cosmic knifeswitch.

        — Here, dumbo.
    </div>

    <div title="Drawing Room">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You f‌ind yourself in a spacious English drawing room. — 'Ere now, 'oo's this bleedin' geek wi' the Whitley Strieber
        phiz on?

        The room is f‌illed with Cockney artists hunched over drafting tables, scrabbling away with pencils and paintbrushes.
        Some of them are producing frames for an animated f‌ilm about two cute Scotch terriers and a winsome badger.
        Others seem to be working on a feature about a diabolical washing machine that mutilates middleclass housewives.
        You begin to suspect that the two f‌ilms may be connected. A man in full body armor strides creakingly up and down
        the aisles, lashing out occasionally with a cat-o-nine-tails.

        — Shut up and get back on the slog, the armored gent says to the one who accosted you, applying the lash
        halfheartedly. He turns in your direction and raises his visor. It's Stephen A. Tate.
    </div>

    <div title="Mistaken">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Tate staggers toward you, hauling his metal clothing along with him. He reaches out and lif‌ts up your mask — Oh,
        it's you, he observes. He sounds disappointed.

        — You were expecting maybe Reed Richards?

        Tate drops his visor back into place and gives one of the artists an experimental thrashing. — No, he says, pausing
        on the upswing, actually I thought you might be...

        — Eh?

        — Ourmysterious keynote speaker.

        — Who?

        — Nevermind.
    </div>

    <div title="Tate Reboots">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You f‌ind the nearest rheostat and twist it till the room dims down to near blackness. This takes Tate by surprise and
        he's caught up in the state-change algorithm, before he knows what’s going on he's been redef‌ined down to a nearly
        immobile pair of eyes.

        — Dirty trick, Tate protests, trying f‌uriously to invoke a subroutine.

        You allow your palm to linger over the switch. — Don't tempt me. Now what was that about a mysterious speaker?
        Tate winks his left eye three times. — ESCAPE-PF13? he tries. Command-period?

        — Talk, you insist.

        — CONTROL-ALT-DELETE! he cries and vanishes in a f‌lash of blue light.
    </div>

    <div title="Great Hall">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        The lights come up slowly and you see that you are in a gigantic hall of assembly, a room made out of two European
        football stadiums, one inverted and laid rim-to-rim on the other. In fact the tiers of seats continue all the way up the
        roof‌line. receding endlessly into the darkness high high up, so high and so far that the vertigo starts in, you feel
        yourelf falling up, losing def‌inition, expanding/shrinking unable even to scrEAM...

        No. Intervene. Lucid now. Pellucid.

        You’re standing there all alone in the assembly hall. Well not really alone, because a few hundred yards up ahead,
        way up there on the f‌lag-draped rostrum, a tiny f‌igure is moving.

        He raises his arms above his head. The lights come all the way up.
    </div>

    <div title="Miles &amp; Miles">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You are running toward the rostrum, it seems miles upon miles away &amp; now the lights are burningly bright and you
        see that the room is not deserted after all but it's f‌illed with Miles upon Miles, hundreds of thousands of
        conventioneers wearing masks of your face &amp; you try not to look at them though it's a remarkable likeness &amp; you're
        running f‌lat out now as hard as you can but you haven't made any progress at all, the rostrum still looks like an
        architectural model in the distance &amp; the man upon it looks down at you with a face whose features you you imprint
        in your memory but somehow you know you'll never be able to call them back or describe them to anyone &amp; your
        heart is pounding &amp; the breath catches in your throat the sweat comes pouring off your scalp &amp; the faces on the
        rows of conventioneers your face they've f‌lashed into a blur you must be passing forty or f‌ifty Miles a minute &amp; at
        this speed you're bound to get there you're bound to get somewhere or else —

        ESCAPE VELOCIIY, the P.A. announces. The audience stands to applaud.

    <div title="Eat">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        The fourth wall of the auditorium melts away your body is going ballistic uncontrollable aimed of‌f the curve of the
        earth out where the planets spin you'll be lost and gone forever into cosmic exile like that Silver Surfer only without
        the paint job

        but just before this happens you manage to reach out and grasp the rostrum by its carven prow

        so everything stops

        looking down you see what you've got in your hands — and it really is an architectural model

        and the two-inch f‌igure standing on it with his arms upraised is made of marzipan good to eat a thousand years. All
        this dreaming sure can raise an appetite.

    <div title="Silence">
        There was a sustained monumental silence in the room, not so much an impressed or startled silence as a kind of

    <div title="The Watchtower">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You are standing on the watchtower, which seems to extend considerably beyond the Earth's atmosphere. The
        curvature of the planet is clearly visible. The watchman is standing on his spar, smearing his thinning locks with
        lamb fat.

        "Oe," you say. "What's the meaning of this."

        The watchman regards you. He is kind of dark and Sicilian-Sephardic-looking, sort of a cross between Richard Nixon
        and Neil Postman. His little pigseyes catch you in their gaze.

        "Well. You're no angel."

        "But I wanna get to heaven just the same."

    <div title="Perfectly Sensible">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        "Yeah," the watchman says in a tone of great resignation. He calls your attention to the grease job on his pate.
        "Just look at that."

        "It all makes perfect sense," you assure him.

        "Not for a minute. So let me tell you a story."

        "Oh mercy," you hear yourself say.
    </div>

    <div title="Watchman">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        "Eighteen thousand years I been up here," the watchman begins. "Since the second Eisenhower administration. I
        was put here to watch. What am I supposed to watch for? I thought to ask. That's your lookout, they said, just you
        watch. So I sat up here and I watched. And I watched. And I watched some more."

        "Then you saw it," you suggest.

        "No actually I saw it the f‌irst f‌ive minutes I was up here. But after all I was told to watch, right? so after I saw it I
        went on watching."

        "Well obviously."

        "But guess what I saw."
    </div>

    <div title="Angelology">

        "Great wings it had, and f‌iery feathers, and in girth it was mightier than a fullgrown Edsel."

        "Jeepers Mister Wilson."

        "And behold it had eyes of creased neon and a beak of surgical steel and the countenance of a professional
        wrestler."

        "Holy cow."

        The watchman holds up a wizened foref‌inger. "Not exactly," he says. "Actually I'm convinced it was an angel."
    </div>

    <div title="Charlie Tuna">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        "Of course." you say, slapping your forehead. "I should have seen it instantly."

        "The lamb's fat is to attract them," the watchman says. "If I can lure one close enough I'm hoping it will fetch me
        back to the nest."

        "Well obviously."
    </div>

    <div title="Solsbury Hill">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Presently a large bright blue angel with civilian markings appears out of the terminator and comes swooping over at
        a speed just shy of escape velocity. The angel barrels in, making a noise like a calliope in dif‌iculties. Its creased
        neon eyes swivel, scrutinizing the greasy dome of the watchman. It circles around a few times. You discern its
        nostrils in contraction. It circles a few more times.

        You see the surgical steel claws lock into position.

        "Oboyoboyoboy," says the watchman, trying not to f‌idget.

        The angel zooms up and snatches you off the tower.

    <div title="Special Delivery">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The angel is f‌lying straight into the sun, which seems to you not so much a blinding radiance or a f‌iery furnace or a
        celestial presence but a horrible clean well lighted place.

        You are convinced that you will f‌ind it f‌illed with stoic expatriates of your grandfather's generation who will tell
        endless tales of moose hunting and start pathetic f‌istf‌ights and force you to buy them drinks for all eternity.

        "Yaaaaa," you f‌ly to tell the angel, but the angel has already released you in a sort of Stuka maneuver and you are

        No one knows who named the cof‌fee house in the University of Tara Union "The Saloon of Tomorrow," or why that
        name was chosen, or even when. There was a rumor once about a disco conversion involving kickbacks to certain
        Congressmen of the Commonwealth, but so far as anyone knows the place has always been what it is — dark
        woods, limestone, and cacti, happily seedy. Somewhere to relax and bitch, a place to lift your glass and snarl.

        Which explains the name by which everyone really calls it — the Just Say No Cafe. An eighties sentiment, yes, but
        also a cry from the heart of graduate students everywhere. The No is where you give it up and face what is. The No
        is where those at work on the higher problems of being drift down to face their ordinary blues — obscurity,
        unemployment, and the prospect of ten more years in cheap apartments.

        There is good beer, the music changes nightly, and the help is friendly.
    </div>

    <div title="Nice Girls">
        <prolepsis>On this November evening the No was showcasing that well-known trio from down in Texas, Two Nice Girls. They
        sang:

        I spent my last ten dollars on birthcontrol
        and beer
        My life was so much simpler when I was sober
        and queer
        But the love of a strong hairy man has turned my head I fear
        And made-me-spend my last-ten-bucks on birthcontrol
        and beer.

        You could tell this was going over well because most of the crowd in the No actually stopped complaining for a
        minute. The women began to smile. A couple of them sang along.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Adoration">
        <prolepsis>But Harley Morgan evidently wasn't paying attention, because when the waitress showed up with his pitcher of
        bock he not only made eyes at her, he caught her hand and pressed it against his own hairy chest.

        "God how I adore you," Harley declared.

        The waitress f‌lushed and parked the pitcher with a deliberate slosh into Harley's lap. "I need this," she protested,
        extracting her hand.

        "Creep," observed a fellow in hornrims at the next table.

        Boris Urquhart leaned across to cover for his old friend. "It’s okay, this time I believe he means it."

        "Shithead," muttered the critic.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Listen Up">
        <prolepsis>"I might adore you too," Veronica Runbird allowed (for it was she), "but only after hours. So now be a good paying
        customer, drink your beer and listen up. You could learn something."

        For there're certain thrills that lesbian love just cannot supply
        Like paying for abortions from sperm gone awry
        And so I say to you my friends, without this man I'd die
        So listen to my tale of woe, and hang your heads and cry...

        "I don't know," Urquhart mused. "It’s enough to make one ashamed of one's willy."

        "Give you a ride home later?" Harley asked Veronica.

        Veronica nodded and ducked in to kiss the back of his neck before swinging off toward another table.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Stone in Love">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart served out the beer with Germanic precision, mindful of the shape and dynamics of the head. He was
        preparing to interrogate. "So. What's between you two is something... important?"

        Harley nodded vaguely, his mind and eye elsewhere.

        "It's what we might call a serious attachment?"

        "It's what we might call 'stone in love.'"

        Urquhart sipped his beer, considering. The Nice Girls followed into a critique d'amour in which the speaker kept
        wishing for a Rational Heart.

        "Veronica was born on the morning Bobby Kennedy died," he noted. "By which time, I believe, you had technically
        lost your virginity."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Irrational Heart">
        <prolepsis>"Boris, you are an old man."

        "Don't get this wrong," Urquhart advised. "Veronica is a wonderful person, and I don't say that just because of my
        attachment to her sister. She's young, she's smart, she's a hardheaded woman who stands apart even in this home of
        the weird."

        "Don't forget she's astoundingly beautiful."

        "That too. Astounding." He gave Harley a long, hard look.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Unfit">
        <prolepsis>"But what about this Harley Morgan I see sitting here?" Urquhart pursued. "Our Harley is no undergraduate. Our
        Harley has just rounded thirty-f‌ive. What’s more, he's a very confused fellow. He's a celebrity, or he once was. He
        has a mission, or he used to. Our Harley talks to senators and vice presidents. Our Harley gets migraines. He lives
        in airports, or on the air."

        "So?"

        "So I don't understand this thing. You two don't f‌it."

        Harley gave him his relatively undivided attention. "How come you turned so rational all of a sudden?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Rose Tattoo">
        <prolepsis>Harley found one of her red-gold hairs on the collar of his bomber jacket. He held it to the light, fetishizing. "Catch
        up, Boris. It's the dif‌ference between us that's the point."

        "Say what?"

        "She's what I'm not. She's food coops and vintage clothes and mismatched earrings. She's ska and funk and
        after-hours bands. She lives on ninety-f‌ive hundred a year and has an actual rose tattoo."

        "Well, gee: I've got a Smurf myself."

        "Press-on's don't count. She has no car, no credit cards, and she doesn't even own a TV."

        Urquhart shook his head. "What would Ted Turner say."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Something Wild">
        <prolepsis>Harley winced. "I know exactly what Cap'n T. or Bernie or even Fitzmaurice would say about her. Something like,
        'Well Harley, guess the sixties aren't over afterall, go for it, dude.'"

        "And I thought academics were cynical."

        He reached out and took Urquhart by the forearm, a rare thing for a reticent guy like Harley. "It's not like that."

        "Okay, it’s not."

        "She's not just my walk on the wild side. I love her."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Thanks for the Advice">
        Urquhart, always a sucker for the histrionic, got hold of Harley's other arm to close the circuit.

        "Okay, toreador. Just you remember, watch your ass."

        Harley rolled his eyes. "Look who's talking."
    </div>

    <div title="Halftones">
        Veronica Runbird looks at her hand laid over the curve of Harley's back. Ms. and Mr. Halftone, she thinks, ivory and
        ebony, coal and snow. Just like <analepsis>TV from the thirties</analepsis> before Marshall McLuhan discovered the theory of living color.
        Though in fact it's not a matter of black and white but shades of gray. The radiance of the tube turns their bodies
        turn to shadow, and if these shadows have offended, well...

        They've made love with the TV going again, an unbreakable habit from <analepsis>his days on the newsbeat.</analepsis> He can't for a
        moment give up the input. She'll check sometimes while sucking his cock; if his eye starts to wander she knows
        what to do, but still. A lover shouldn't have to put up with this.

        Dear daughters and sons unborn, she ref‌lects, never lay you down with a television journalist. But when you do,
        pull all the plugs in the room f‌irst.
    </div>

    <div title="Sea Me">
        <prolepsis>Harley, being male and very nicely fucked thank you, has gone off chasing r.e.m.'s. He is having his recurrent dream
        about dissolution. Therapy tells him it's an anxiety dream but Harley has his doubts. The dream feels so good.
        Therapy argues that this is because Harley only feels good when he feels bad. Harley is giving up on therapy.

        It's one of those dreams where you have no body but you do have a very keen sense of place. The place is a sort of
        Greco-Irish Monterey, a stretch of blue water which Harley knows in incredible detail and all at once: every bluff and
        gulley, each eddy and wavelet, all the f‌lora and fauna down to the last frond of kelp streaming in the tides. The place
        is haunted by a pod of great whales with whom Harley is intimate. One of these whales, who tours under the name
        Dupont, is trying to clarify things for Harley.

        One day, Dupont explains, you dived into these waters without properly sealing your head. Et voila...</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Remember Winter">
        <prolepsis>Veronica slips out of bed and back into her skirt, loping toward the window on the balls of her feet. She hoists the
        sash and takes the chill air in on her shoulders and breasts, trying to remember winter. It's her own persistent vice,
        this nostalgia for cold places: burgs like Nashua, New Hampshire, Milford, Connecticut, and Paterson, New Jersey,
        these fragments of New England representing <analepsis>spots of happiness that f‌lashed across her gypsy childhood.</analepsis>

        "Child, you got a screw loose or what?" Harley usually says to her, having spent enough miserable freezing
        Februaries in that part of the world.

        But one of the reasons she loves him is because he counts as a northerner, never mind that <analepsis>the six-letter word used
        to describe his family was never "Yankee," or that his New England was Roxbury and Lowell long before it was
        Andover and Dartmouth.</analepsis></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Dreamwork">
        <prolepsis>Harley's dream breaks up the way those things do, jammed by commercial messages out of spiritus mundi. He opens
        his eyes and gropes for pad and pencil but f‌inds himself staring at the blank page with his memory in much the same
        state. He is able to bring back something about <analepsis>a porpoise and a chemical ref‌inery</analepsis> but the traces are too cold and it's
        no story. So much for getting in touch with his dreamlife; sometimes he wishes he was back on the air.

        "Did you save any of it?" Veronica asks and he shakes his head. "Suppose we try it next time without the media,"
        she says, giving the set a poke with her toe.

        "Close the damned window," he says contentedly. "Then why'nt you bring your ass over here where it's wanted."

        A roll of the eyes, a shake of her golden locks.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Peace Now">
        <prolepsis>Veronica leaves the window as it is and slides in beside him, feeling the f‌lesh of his chest still warm with sleep
        against her back. She takes his right hand in her own and settles it between her breasts, picking up the beat of his
        pulse. She shuts her eyes and goes to work on snowdrifts and pond ice and birches.

        Harley covers the little rise of her belly with his left hand and for once her head isn't full of her body's imperfections,
        she doesn't even f‌idget, just lies there feeling f‌ine. He kisses the cool mass of hair along her nape and she rolls her
        hips gently, feeling him stir through the fabric of the skirt. It's a thought, but nobody’s in a hurry.

        Watch closely, angels: this is one of those impossible moments, deceptively quiet but oh so far from equilibrium. It
        can't last and they know it. They don't care. They’re at peace.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Far From It">
        "We all have strange dreams," Urquhart pointed out. "They're nothing to quit your job about. They're just an index
        of how fucked up you are, nature's little reminder that what we call rationality is a state very far from equilibrium.
        What's your shrink say?"

        "Mainly she says 'thank you very much' when I hand in my check."

        "Aha."

        Harley put out his f‌inger and the grackle prodded it experimentally. "I thought you were interested in dreams," he
        said.

        "Well," Urquhart allowed, "I guess I an in a certain overly theorized way."

        "Listen to this one."

        that swarming sensation again. Dan Rather turns to Walter Cronkite, who says: "Y'know Dan it seems to me as I
        think about the world's future that each day we're likely to resign ourselves to more atrocious undertakings — why,
        pretty soon there'll be no one in the geopolitical arena but warriors and brigands."

        Then they cut to this public service spot featuring Edward James Olmos, who stares at the camera and says: The
        author of an atrocious undertaking ought to imagine that he has already accomplished it, ought to impose upon
        himself a future as irrevocable as the past.

        Must be some kind of anti-drug spot.

    <div title="What the Freak">
        What's the frequency, Kenneth?

        - <analepsis>Question once put to Dan Rather</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Freak Whence He">
        I don't know, maybe I was just behind the door when the Rational Explanation was given out, but so far as I recall
        the incident is still unsolved. <analepsis>Some loony runs up to Rather on the steps of his Manhattan brownstone, starts
        pounding on his face, yelling, "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"</analepsis>

        A question that grows more interesting as you try to build it a context. What exactly is the frequency of moments
        like that one, spots when the Fabric wears a little too thin and the lunacy seeps through, giving us a forbidden
        glimpse of Mother Chaos beneath?

        How often can we expect these intimations? And what if the frequency should change... if it should increase?

        What's it mean when we start to get these little hints all the time?
    </div>

    <div title="?Para No?">
        That voice in your head growing each time a little more shrill, a bit more sawtoothed about the wavefom rising

    <div title="Here's Another Hint">
        Indulge me for a minute. Maybe you recall <analepsis>the curious events of January 22. We'd just tuned in for our nightly
        dispatches from the Babylon front, feeling all those frissonettes of apocalypse, thinking about all the bad things that
        might be impending. And then shazam, speak of the devil, Rather gets cut off right in the middle of his Evening
        Newscast. What was that frequency, Kenneth?

        It recurs something like an hour later in the middle of McNeil-Lehrer. Jim sits there dragging out some pointless
        encounter with Stansf‌ield Turner because he can't cut back to Robin in New York. Why? Because a "non-violent
        but insistent" protester has handcuf‌fed himself to the anchor desk.</analepsis>

        Is this something our viewers need to know about?

    <div title="Acting Up">
        Turns out both of these rude intrusions on our News-As-The-World were executed by ACTUP, the
        consciousness-raising group f‌ighting the conspiracy of silence about AIDS.

        The incident gave all the network priests a chance to exercise their Attitude about the sanctity of editorial decisions.
        But the joke was most patently on them. They had no option really — absence is presence. Turning the cameras off
        just magnif‌ied the message. And now this.

        It was admirable in fact, a shining instance of paranoia militant. Networks have loathed bad news since <analepsis>Nixon and
        Wallace put the Silent Majority on them in '68.</analepsis> But the war is some kind of therapeutic overdose. Its potential for
        badness is so great that it drives out everything else. It's a perfect excuse to forget the AIDS holocaust, not to
        mention, oh, the recession and Neil Bush.

        But now this.
    </div>

    <div title="Death Live">
        So there's your explanation and now you can take that footage from Network and stow it back on the shelf. We
        know <analepsis>what you were thinking and you were Wrong.</analepsis> No assault guns in the newsroom, no Jack Ruby murder show
        live on our stage. Not tonight. Not this, not now.

        To be sure, a few questions are left open. We're not sure how <analepsis>the protesters got past Network security</analepsis> but you can't
        do the Evening News from a closed set. We suppose it might happen again. Sure it could be Abu Nidal next time,
        the message might be different, the medium might be blood.

        We don't see any need to take this line of reasoning further.
    </div>

    <div title="Paranalysis">
        <analepsis>The break-ins were a message,</analepsis> of course. But are we reading the message properly? Are we on the right frequency?
        What if someone wanted to remind the networks not about the stories they choose not to cover, but about the
        stories they pray they'll never have to cover?

        What if this was somebody's little way of saying, Get back...
    </div>

    <div title="Reality Check">
        Hard to take such claims seriously. As we've all been taught, nature abhors a conspiracy and, well, shit just
        happens. Get back in line and stop that thinking you'll work yourself into some kind of social disease.

        Okay, so it wasn't Sununu and Fitzwater drawing those pentagrams down in the White House Paranoia Room,
        calling up Hoover's ghost to seal their curse on the head of Kenneth. That didn't happen.

        The Fact Is there's no need to invent conspiracy theories. Get out your Occam's Razor and slice away. Seems that
        <analepsis>NBC lost $55 million covering the Gulf war,</analepsis> CBS's losses for the year may come to f‌ive or six times that. With

        A sensitivity to patterns, parallels, correspondences. A higher scrutiny, in every sense of the word.

        On February 10, 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is winding up a tour of the Gulf. During a photo

        Cheney. Something like that.

        On February 14, 1991, f‌irst reports of the A1 Amiriya shelter bombing appear in the western press. U.S. Stealth
        f‌ighters made two direct hits on what the Pentagon still insists was a reinforced military command-and-control
        bunker. Between three and four hundred Iraqi civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in the attack.

        The ordnance used against the Al Amiriya bomb shelter was a 2,000-pound GBU-27 laser-guided "smart" bomb.

        Of course it wasn't <analepsis>the one that Cheney personally endorsed.</analepsis>

        Generally speaking Madden had nothing against those good citizens who would call him up now and then for a

        informers — call them snitches, turncoats, deep sources — they were an essential part of his work.

        Like everybody else on the street, Madden had learned to see himself as a buyer and seller of information — with a
        certain value-added that he persisted in calling Justice. So who was he to harbor resentment toward his suppliers?

        <analepsis>For f‌ifteen years Gerry Madden had put on a friendly face for dealers big and small, for local pimps and international

        names.

        Madden found himself puzzled and a bit distracted, suddenly out of concentration. He tried to focus on Heidel,
        sitting across the room nattering on with the usual mix of rumor, fear, and rank suspicion. Nothing strange in that,
        though the way he used the word "subversion" did have a certain nostalgic kick. The guy was a jerk, a low-order
        crank like many another. So why was it that when Madden performed a gut check he came up with something a little
        stronger than disgust?

        Something a bit too familiar about the case, perhaps?</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Paranoid He">
        <prolepsis>"I don't consider myself a paranoid, Agent Madden."

        No reason to doubt that. You didn't need Madden's professional expertise to read the sense of injured conviction
        and probity in that round-eyed stare. "I'm not talking about plots and conspiracies. It's all in the open, anybody can
        see what's going on. Our educational system is completely out of step with the rest of the country, and it's the fault
        of this radical clique who pull all the strings."

        Madden dutifully wrote something.

        "In the seventies, when the rest of the country woke up and faced facts, these people just went deeper into their
        own radicalism, further away from reality. You remember how that was."

        There was an edge to this remark that Madden couldn't ignore. "I suppose so."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Naming Names">
        <prolepsis>"Just out of idle curiosity, who are we talking about here?" Madden inquired.

        Heidel had his index ready to go. "Berkowitz in Sociology, Sanchez-Ochoa of Hispanic Cultures, Agnew and most of
        her curricular revision committee, including that nut case Boris Urquhart f‌rom Simulated Science or whatever they
        call themselves."

        This last item did ring a bell, if not an actual alarm. Madden made a mental note. "I think it's called the Center for
        Virtual Realities." A group — and a name — that had recently come to his attention.

        "Whatever."

        Madden turned on a medium-heavy stare. "The Center does a fair amount of SDI work," he observed.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Serious">
        <prolepsis>"You see how serious a business it is," Heidel insisted. "The subversion of America's academic institutions strikes
        directly at the intellectual foundations of national security."

        Madden considered. There was a ring of marketability, if not of truth. But did it have anything to do with the blind
        lady and her scales?

        "Are you suggesting that someone like Urquhart might be responsible for security breaches at the VR center?"
        Madden asked.

        Heidel shrugged. "Not that I know for certain, but you do hear things. Right at the moment I'm a lot more concerned
        about the general intellectual climate here at the U. of T. This effort to demolish Western Civilization, for instance."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Thanks">
        <prolepsis>Madden dragged a book off the shelf and idly wiped some dust from the binding with his f‌ingertips.

        "Thanks but no thanks, Dr. Heidel. I don't think the District Director could get behind that one. The Bureau got
        enough of a bad aroma from that sort of play back in the f‌ifties. Even Mister Hoover got his bellyful of witchhunting
        at the end."

        Heidel gave him that he-doesn't-understand-me look that Madden knew oh so well.

        "You don't get it, do you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Posterior">
        <prolepsis>"Post-history," Heidel recited with evident disgust. "Postindustrialism. Postmodernism. Post-humanism. If there
        weren't so many of them who take it seriously, I'd f‌ind it all laughable. It's gotten to the point where I'm ashamed to
        talk about what I do."

        "Well," Madden allowed, "I certainly know that feeling."

        "They're all so eager to leave things behind — to leave us behind," Heidel pointed out. "They want to pretend
        they're in another country, a country without any connection to our heritage of laws and beliefs, our common
        adherence to reason and the rule of law."

        Madden uncrossed his legs and got slowly to his feet. "Sounds serious, Professor. But I'm afraid you're in a better
        position to deal with it than I am."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Transcript">
        LK: Professor Heidel, in the last few months there's been a lot in the media about changes in the Western Culture
        requirement for undergraduates at the University of Tara. I think it's safe to say that this is no longer a local
        matter but an issue that has gained national attention. Could you please tell us brief‌ly, in your opinion, what all
        the fuss is about.

        EH: I'd be glad to, Larry. When you get through all the rhetoric, in which I might add Professor Agnew is a
        specialist, what you see is an attempt by a handful of tenured radicals to subvert humanistic education as we have
        known it at the U. of T. Basically they're trying to uproot two thousand years of history and culture and replace it
        with their own narrow, highly politicized ideas.
    </div>

    <div title="Hostage">
        <prolepsis>LK: What exactly are we talking about here? What specific changes have these alleged radicals talked about?

        EH: Well it's hard to know f‌or sure, Larry, since the Committee has repeatedly refused my requests f‌or information.
        We do know they've proposed to drop as many as six major authors f‌rom the f‌irst-year syllabus — writers like St.
        Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and Alexander Pope. In their place they would substitute work by obscure women
        and writers from the so-called 'Colonized World.'

        LK: And you object to this...

        EH: Oh I don't object to periodically reconsidering what academics call 'the canon.' But the changes this group
        has proposed hold our Western Civ course hostage to a highly unepresentative idea of political correctness.'</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Apolitical">
        <prolepsis>LK: This does sound like a serious debate, Professor Heidel. But don't you have your own political agenda?

        EH: Well certainly I've been the subject of such charges and worse, Larry, but I think most Americans and even the
        majority of academics would acknowledge that the defense of our Western heritage and value system is not a
        matter of politics. Opposition to the Agnew committee has come from all sides of the political spectrum at the U. of
        T. We're not the ones doing the politicizing. We're only interested in giving the young people of Tara a sound
        introduction to the life of the mind.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Solid Foundation">
        LK: Professor Heidel, in 1989 you founded a group called the Educational Freedom Foundation, whose charter
        reads in part: 'We will work to expose and oppose special interests and left-wing pressure groups whenever they
        become a threat to academic f‌reedom.' Could you tell us more about the E.F.F. and its activities?

        EH: The Foundation is just an association of concerned scholars f‌rom around the country. We depend on
        volunteer effort and some modest support from private charities. We publish a newsletter and coordinate with
        media and opinion leaders to reveal undemocratic and restrictive practices like those of the Agnew Committee on
        my campus.

        LK: Do you draw a salary as head of this group?

        EH: No I don't Larry, though I do have a small support budget to take care of printing, mailing, and
        miscellaneous overhead.
    </div>

    <div title="Insidious">
        "The laughable part," Thea ref‌lected, "is that you'd think from all the shit we've stirred up that we're some kind of
        major threat."

        Urquhart held his cheroot between his teeth and grimaced. "I'm a pretty dangerous type. Don't know about you."

        "That's rich, Boris." She spread the mail out over the top layer of clutter on her desk. "Christ, all we're trying to do
        is revise a University humanities requirement. Don't people have better things to worry about?"

        Urquhart picked up a swatch of newsprint. "The actions of the Revised Curriculum Committee represent a
        perilous trend, one that may insidiously undermine traditional values in American higher education."

        Thea shook her head. "And that's probably one of the nicer ones."
    </div>

    <div title="Motives">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart tore the clipped column deliberately from top to bottom. "I refute it thus." They sat for a while in quiet
        violation of the anti-smoking ordinance. Thea picked up the Larry King transcript and read with mounting disgust.
        Frowning, grumbling moaning. She put the paper down.

        "Boris," she said, "I know why I'm mixed up in all this garbage. It's something to do with racism and patriarchy,
        making sure we learn from history. We can change the world. Like that."

        "Western Civ is what you're having instead of a happy Sixties," Urquhart summarized.

        She nodded. "Okay, plausible. Maybe that f‌igures me out. Maybe Marty Gleeson and Diane too — just like Heidel
        and his goon squad say, a bunch of diehards who didn't get with the Reagan program. But where does that leave
        you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="What About Boris?">
        "What about me?" Urquhart asked.

        "Well to start with, you're a scientist. I know the distinction bothers you, I know you care about things like culture
        and representation and literacy, but you're off in your research center playing Star Wars games, why should you
        bother with the Humanities curriculum?"

        He looked at her over the rim of his shades. "Maybe I want to change the world too."

        "Why?"

        He stubbed out his cigar, trying to bring his thoughts to sharper focus. "Because it can be different. Because it...
        needs to be."

        A little smile came to her face. "You were born too late."
    </div>

    <div title="Chances">
        <prolepsis>"Okay," Thea granted "I'll stop questioning your commitment. So let's talk strategy — what do you think our
        chances are?"

        Urquhart ref‌lected. "Well I doubt they'll actually lynch us. Tar and festschrif‌t maybe."

        "Be serious, Boris. We have the upper hand here. We're the duly authorized committee. We're the ones appointed
        by the Dean and Faculty. Okay, the President wishes we'd disappear, but so what. I don't mind a f‌ight, but come on.
        Don't you think Heidel and his stonm troopers will just have to pack it in at some point?"

        "Hard to say. The balance of power in this place lies pretty high."

        "As high as, say, the Provost?" Urquhart nodded slowly.

        "Tate." She lit another cigarette, speculating. "Who can say?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="10,000 Heroes">
        Hallowe'en, All Saints' Eve, So'an... we put something down in the ground and now it returns to us on this Night of
        Open Doors ...though like everything else these days I'm afraid what was once sacred has worn down to
        entertainment, a pageant of gourds and ghoul-children, another ratchet stop on the spinning wheel of Commerce...

        ...or if you'd rather skip the critique, like tonight's celebrants here, well then you can just call it a masquerade, a
        festival of seeming, occasion for a quick change of face.

        The invitation, written out according to tradition in the Provost's own hand and nailed to the door of the Philosophy
        Department, named the occasion Hero With Ten Thousand Faces. You were supposed to come as the person you
        most admired. Though there was this option clause in very f‌ine print for those who couldn't think of anyone to f‌it
        the bill. In that case you could come as someone else's hero.
    </div>

    <div title="Our Heroes">
        <prolepsis>Most of the choices were predictable — several hundred showed up as Elvis, Madonna, Axl Rose, or Jesus; or as
        unspecif‌ied punks, metalheads, pro wrestlers, ninja turtles. Others were more interesting: a Barbara Jordan, a Mitch
        Snyder, and the rugby team who came as Christa McAuliffe. Nor should we forget that dedicated group who arrived
        in black tights and sandwich boards bearing the names of great women whose faces we don't know (Jane Adams,
        Amelia Earhart, Barbara McClintock, int. a1.).

        But as you might expect, given the geopolitics of this Hallowe'en, the night really belonged to Heroes of the Desert.

        There were variations on the basic concept — several impersonations of TV's Rat Patrol, including one couple done
        up as the jeeps, about a dozen Lawrences of Arabia (and those cries of "No prisoners!" got old real fast), a handful
        of Pattons and a Rommel. Still, most folks had their minds on the Gulf. The Stormin' Nonman look seemed de
        rigueur for faculty in Engineering but mostly what you had was Grunts.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Absent Brothers">
        <prolepsis>A few with political attitudes showed up in gas masks or environment suits but most wore plain fatigues painted to
        look like that "pebbled" camouf‌lage.

        Assuming most of them took tonight's theme at face value, this was a poignant statement indeed. You had here
        girlfriends and boyfriends decked out in their lovers' G.I. drag, brothers by blood and bond standing in for absent
        brothers — all fun and games of course (it's the American way) but beneath it just possibly something deeper —
        could it be solidarity?

        Harley was fascinated. He leaned against the base of the Tower making extensive notes. "Hey," Veronica objected,
        "I thought you were on stress leave."

        Which was quite a concept, considering the way he looked.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Going West">
        <prolepsis>They were both something to see. <analepsis>Harley and Veronica had gone with the option clause and come as each other's
        totem, which turned out to be a happy decision. It was a dead cinch for Veronica to do Harley's hero, John Lennon,
        just a matter of slipping on an old boyfriend's biker jacket, pulling back her hair with a rubber band and her breasts
        with an ace bandage. Harley's side of the deal looked harder, since Veronica's main idol was Billie Holliday. But she
        settled for Bob Marley, which required Harley only to trim his beard and rent some dreadlocks down on East Main.</analepsis>

        "Say rastaman." A guy in an ape suit came over and gave Harley some skin, or in this case fur. It was Miles
        Macarthur as the Mighty Kong complete with little motorized biplanes buzzing around his head. "Want y'all to meet
        our host this evening, Provost of the University of Tara, Mister Jimmybob Vico, aka. Stephen A. Tate."

        "Charmed," said Tate, sticking out his palm. His theme was indeed the Revival of Learning Goes West: doublet,
        hose, and ten-gallon hat.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Decline of Man">
        <prolepsis>"Some party you throw here," Harley noted, gazing over a phalanx of masked and painted faces that stretched all the
        way to the Capitol. "I'd size this crowd at about forty-f‌ive hundred. Is it always this big?"

        Tate excused himself and adjusted his codpiece, saying something under his breath about the decline of man. "No
        sir, Mr. Morgan, this year is quite special. Whether it's the war or just something in the air I couldn't rightly say."

        "It's all those hormones in the hamburgers," said a woman in a white strapless cocktail dress who was doing a very
        plausible Marilyn Monroe. She leaned over to kiss Tate on the lips. "Thea?" Tate marveled. Macarthur scratched
        his brow ridges. Thea as the Sex Goddess?

        "Whatsamatter, you think I didn't want to fuck the Kennedys too?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Doubly Incorrect">
        "Hmm. Not exactly what you'd call Pee Cee," Veronica pointed out.

        At which Thea's face positively lit up, aha just what I hoped you'd say, and everybody started to get that little
        theatrical f‌lutter we experience just before the curtain goes up. "You're right," she conceded, "this outf‌it is
        politically incorrect." She did a little pirouette and pointed her toes. "But more to the point, it’s also
        anatomically incorrect."

        "Oboy," said Miles, who had an inkling. Thea planted her feet about eighteen inches apart and set her hands on her
        hips, triggering an ingenious pneumatic system sewn into the lining of her dress. A series of f‌lexors f‌lexed and
        tensors tensed, causing her skirt to f‌loat up as if in a funhouse jet.

        "Whee," vamped Thea. Af‌fiixed to the front panel of her tap pants was an inverted but very accurate life mask of her
        colleague, Erich K. Heidel.
    </div>

    <div title="Speaking of U...">
        <prolepsis>Overcome with professional curiosity, Macarthur bent down to get a closer look at the mechanism, drawing quite a
        number of stares from passing partygoers.

        "Like it?" Thea asked. "The concept was mine and the gadgets came out of Urquhart's lab." She leaned close to
        Tate. "I think there was DARPA money involved." She gave them all another quick demonstration. "Boris wanted
        him to talk but I vetoed that idea when I found out where the voice box was going."

        "Speaking of Boris," Tate put in, "has anyone seen him round these parts?"

        There was a general shaking of heads. "Nor around anyone else's parts either, so far as I know," Harley said.
        "Though it's unlike Boris to miss a night like this. Dressing up is sort of his thing."

        Tate tugged on his hatbrim. "So I've heard."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Parley">
        <prolepsis>Tate peered over both his shoulders, dof‌fed his hat and looked again. No sign of Urquhart, or more to the point, of
        any disturbance or police action. "Seeing that I've got you all together and that Boris is not in evidence," Tate said,
        "I wonder if we could retire somewhere for a little serious talk."

        The foursome shrugged. "We're hardly dressed for it," Thea noted, "but I always like to talk to you, Stevie."

        Tate nodded with perhaps more than his usual solemnity and led the way past the merrymakers and a cordon of
        Campus Security into the lobby of the Tower, where they crowded into a tiny, oak-paneled elevator which Thea
        hadn't known existed. After a brief ride up they stepped out into a smallish room that smelled of tung oil and saddle
        soap.

        "Of‌fice of the President," Tate explained. "It'll do for privacy."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Floor Thirteen">
        <prolepsis>They could hear the propellors on Macarthur's little airplanes softly whizzing as they gazed through the
        floor-to-ceiling casements. The Provost's Hallowe'en Party stretched below them, a few thousand faces come
        together to light up the night. Ten thousand heroes.

        "We must be on the thirteenth floor," Veronica thought aloud "I thought no one was allowed up here after —"

        Tate laughed sof‌ily. "Another urban myth. Though I don't think Larry spends much time in this of‌ice, it's true."

        "Try installing a putting green," Thea suggested.

        Tate switched on a reading lamp and beckoned them to a small conference table. "I want to talk to you about Boris,"
        Tate said.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Newsworthy">
        <prolepsis>Tate reached into his doublet and produced a copy of last week's alternative paper, the Tara Happening, featuring
        all over its front page a grainy photo of the town's latest cultural attraction, Uqbari the Pissing Prophet. "Look at it
        this way," Harley pointed out, "if they'd shot from any other angle, the wire services would have snatched it right
        up."

        Tate reached back into his doublet and came out with a UPI photofax. "Skillf‌ul airbrushing," he noted. Macarthur
        scrutinized the print, turning it f‌irst left, then right, then upside down. "Digitally enhanced," he added.

        Tate sighed and pulled one last exhibit from his pocket of surprises. It was Boris Urquhart's standard University
        publicity shot, which he laid edge-to-edge with the wirephoto.

        "Separated at birth?" he asked academically.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Talking Tate">
        <prolepsis>"We'll stipulate that Boris has some problems," Harley tossed out for openers.

        "I think he's just plain gone round the bend," Tate said flatly. "The poor boy is loco in cabeza." He looked around
        the room. "But who am I to talk, having invited f‌ive thousand people below the age of majority to celebrate on my
        front lawn while I strut around dressed for the last act of Hamlet. Here I sit with a man in a motorized ape suit, a
        woman wearing her enemy's face on her pudenda, and at least one cross-dressing pop-singer-impersonator." Tate
        didn't know if Harley was supposed to be Michael Jackson, or if Michael Jackson was supposed to be a man. He
        paused, letting the facts settle in. "I am mindful that academic culture tolerates a great deal of unusual and even
        erratic behavior as the concomitant of creativity. I am also reminded by the University's general counsel that
        distinguishing madness from mere eccentricity can be notoriously hard for those in our line of work."

        "Talk that talk," Thea said.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="What's With Boris?">
        <prolepsis>"Okay we'll cut the crap," Tate considerately turning the other cheek while he shucked out of the codpiece, rolled
        down those hose, and slipped into a pair of faded benmudas. He seemed to be having trouble with the zipper.
        "What's up with Urquhart anyway?"

        Resisting the temptation to peep at her Provost's hindparts, Thea stared over at Miles Macarthur, who shrugged his
        shoulderpads and turned to Harley, who passed the inquisitory gaze right over to you, Veronica. For her part,
        Veronica was checking out the old guy's ass, wondering how anyone could ever f‌ind white men attractive, knowing
        they'd eventually end up like this.

        "Jesus," Tate observed, "you're about as forthcoming as a bunch of graduate students. And you need not
        consider that a compliment, Miss Runbird. Can someone please tell me, I don't care how speculatively, where this
        problem of Urquhart's originates? Is it political? Organic? Intellectual? Erotic? Is the fault in his stars, for
        Chrissake?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="All or None">
        <prolepsis>"None of the above," Macarthur started to say, but halfway through he heard Harley saying, "All of the above," just
        as Harley heard Miles and so both shut up and pretended that neither had spoken.

        "The man's going through a breakdown," Thea said simply. "The way we all do. But where most of us just lie on
        the couch and cry or sit in the office and drink or" — glancing at Veronica —"take our students to bed, what does
        Boris do? He dresses up like National Enemy Number One. He shoots up house parties and pisses in public
        swimming pools. What can you say? Love him as I do, he's always been kind of grandiose. So when he f‌lips, he
        becomes a prophet. He can't just be loony, he has to think he's the only sane person in a world gone mad."

        Veronica stared her down. "Yeah well maybe so. But maybe he's right."

        Macarthur was nodding. "Figuratively speaking, of course."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Now Realize This">
        <prolepsis>Tate cradled his head in his hands. "Well thanks, folks, you've been such a great help." He straightened up and
        somehow f‌ixed them all with a single glare; something only a Provost could manage. "Urquhart's escapades may
        seem trivial from where you sit, but I have to put them in larger perspective. So consider with me a few realities.
        First, this country is very close to some kind of national security emergency in the Gulf — and I say that, Veronica,
        with fervent prayers that your sister will come back safe and soon. Second, Boris Urquhart is engaged in important
        defense-related research about which his sponsors feel extremely protective. Third, like the rest of us he is also
        stuck up to his sternum in this Western Civilization fracas. So you see, this is not a good time for him to be losing
        his sanity in the national press."

        "'National security emergency?'" Harley wondered. Tate scowled at him and reminded him they were off the record
        here.

        "So what are we supposed to do?" Thea asked.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Heroes">
        <prolepsis>"Nothing heroic," Tate assured them. "Certainly nothing to make him feel, ah —"

        "Paranoid?" Miles supplied.

        "Say self-conscious," Tate resumed. "You're his friends. I'm his friend too. Just let me know if you think he's
        beginning to lose it. I'll take the necessary steps."

        This last phrase set Harley's journalistic antennae a—quiver and he was about to jump all over Tate with deep and
        vigorous probes about just how the Govemment might arrange discreet psychiatric treatment for important
        defense-related researchers who cracked up during "national security emergencies." But both Thea and Veronica
        saw this coming so they got him on his feet and hustled him to the door before he could frame a question. Tate
        watched them go.

        "I been muzzled," Harley protested as the elevator started down.</prolepsis>

        <prolepsis>They rode for a few seconds in silence and then Veronica ran out of composure. She slammed a f‌ist against the oak
        panelling. "Who's crazy? Somebody please tell me which one's the lunatic, Boris or our own Provost up there."

        Thea slumped into a corner. "Cool down," she advised. "Nobody’s about to go along with Stevie's little request."

        "You got that right," Harley fumed.

        The car slouched to rest. "That's better," Miles said, breathing easier. "Somehow I don't feel especially secure on
        top of a tower just now. Must be the outf‌it."

        The doors slid back and they started out. Then they stopped.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Guess Who?">
        <prolepsis>"Howdy," Urquhart greeted them, a little nonplussed by their sudden appearance. "What are you all doing in
        Leisure Suit Larry's secret elevator?"

        "Holding an orgy," Harley told him.
        "Heisting classif‌ied f‌iles," Thea confessed.
        "Checking out the view from Thirteen," Veronica suggested.
        "Uh, just leaving," Macarthur tried.

        Urquhart crossed his arms and shrugged. "Well I'm glad I bumped into you anyway. Could you try to remember to
        get a bottle or two of ouzo for later? I just noticed I'm fresh out."

        Each of them nodded at least once. "Sure thing, Boris."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No One But U.">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart shrugged again and stepped between them toward the little elevator. "Gotta run just now I'm afraid. I want
        to f‌ind Tate so I can show him my hero's outf‌it." He stepped back and took a model's turn. "Like it?"

        Somehow nobody could think of anything to say to this. Urquhart hopped aboard the elevator as the doors began
        to slide shut. The car rose invisibly and they heard his voice carry down to them. "Trick or treat."

        For close on a minute the four of them just stood there staring at the false panel that hid the President's elevator.
        There was a single thought in all their minds, though, and it was Harley who f‌inally put it on the record.

        "He was wearing his street clothes," Harley observed.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Hi, Mom">
        Thea started up out of sleep, her dream turned suddenly inside out. <analepsis>A dream of her grandmother's house on the
        Nebraska prairie, Thea pacing the straw mat in the front room as the sky fell dark, the candlef‌lames blown horizontal
        by the wind shrilling through the keyholes. A storm was coming down, a storm whose cold snap she could already
        feel inside her breast. A terrible storm.

        But the storm didn't arrive; something else came in its place. Someone knocking at her door, a tentative rap at f‌irst
        but now steadier. "Hey, Mom. Anybody home?"</analepsis>

        Her eyes were open but for a few seconds she was still in Nebraska, wondering where Grandma Baumann got that
        digital clock. Her eyes focused. 1:58 am, and she wasn't in Nebraska anymore.

        There was more knocking at the door.
    </div>

    <div title="Leroy">
        <prolepsis>Thea pulled a T-shirt over her head and rolled out of bed. Moments like these made her wish she kept a dog instead
        of all these useless cats. Or that her cats were bigger and meaner. She tried to remember where she'd left the
        chemical mace but couldn't recall. Probably inside that hollowed-out copy of One-Dimensional Man where she'd
        kept her stash in happier days. It was on one of these bookshelves somewhere, no telling which. She grabbed the
        next best defense she could think of, a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniels, and headed for the door on quiet feet.

        "Mom?"

        Thea yanked open the door, which didn't seem to be locked. "Roy?"

        She f‌licked on the porch light, revealing a beanpole in black denim with a grimy backpack and dented guitar case.
        The boy waved hello. Leroy Peter Sieger, her only begotten son.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Thirsty">
        <prolepsis>"Any of that for me?" Leroy asked, pantomiming a grab for the whisky.

        "You can't even drive yet," Thea reminded him, tucking the bottle under her arm. "And you're the Just Say No
        generation, remember?" She reached up, hooked her f‌ingers through his Harpo Marx tangles, and hauled him into
        the living room.

        "Do as we say, right?" Leroy replied, shaking back his hair. "After you guys've had all the fun."

        Thea set the bottle down a safe distance from her thirsty son, hit the lights and dropped onto the sofa. "You might
        f‌ind a Corona in the fridge," she conceded. "As in one and only one."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Full of Surprises">
        <prolepsis>She watched him boogie into the kitchen, surprised at how elated the simple sight of him made her. Her son had
        always been full of surprises, usually good ones. She remembered the very f‌irst: <analepsis>Leroy’s arrival three weeks ahead of
        schedule right in the middle of her orals at Yale. For a while she thought the two of them had given Hillis Miller a
        coronary. Oh the days of teaching and learning.</analepsis>

        Which put a certain thought in her head "Say young man," Thea said, "do you happen to know to day's date?"

        Leroy paused in mid-swig. "Ah. October sixth, something like that."

        "More like the eighth. A Monday. And that school of yours up in Pueblo starts the second week of September, am
        I right?"

        Leroy opened the fridge, ostensibly looking for something to eat. Or a place to hide.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Truant">
        <prolepsis>"So," Thea demanded, "what are you doing out of school?"

        A complicated set of changes came over Leroy's expression. He was clearly tempted to invent, only there was too
        much good sense in him, so he went with something like the truth. "It didn't seem like the right place for me just
        now," he explained. "I needed some time on the road."

        Thea shrugged. "Fair enough. Maybe if Dr. Parker agrees he'll refund the ten grand your father and I just paid out."

        "Well, gee, Mom..."

        "Oh, can it and give me a cigarette."

        Now the poor guy looked really mortif‌ied. "Sorry, Mom. I gave them up."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="On the Road">
        <prolepsis>"On the road," Thea said.

        "Yeah." Leroy ducked out the door momentarily to retrieve his backpack, spilling most of its contents on the return
        trip. He came up with a paperback whose binding had long ago come to terms with entropy. "Like Jack," he said
        simply.

        Thea got up and poured a shot of bourbon into a dirty glass. She thought of many things to say, all of them
        stupidly parental. What she did say was, "So how is it that The Road leads to this particular door?"

        Leroy was trying to collate three fragments of his holy text but as he shuff‌led them two of the pieces split into loose
        pages, so he had to give up. "Well," he confessed "turns out that the road of today isn't exactly what it was for
        Jack."

        "What do you know."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Refuge from the Road">
        <prolepsis>"Kind of short on romance, was it?" Thea asked giving in and fetching him another beer.

        "It was plain depressing," Leroy admitted. "I spent three days trying to get a ride out of Dallas. In the end I had to
        get on the 'Hound."

        Somehow this wasn't a surprise. The jeans he had on looked stif‌f enough to stand in the corner and the clothes
        spilled from his backpack were ranker still. His underwear (both pairs) were truly unmentionable. He smelled of
        diesel, truckstop grease, and many many days of sweat. Hardly the right fashion statement for Big D, that gaudy
        and self-righteous buckle on the Bible Belt.

        "I don't think your Jack ever went to Dallas," Thea observed.

        "From what I saw," Leroy concluded "he wasn't even in the same country."</prolepsis>

        You might have been among the half million shipped out to Armageddon, in which case it was no news to you.

        Blowtorch f‌lares from F—l5 Strike Eagles burning above "a large airbase somewhere in Saudi Arabia"... Street maps

        these shots as rushes ... Ominous blue domes glowing against the night sky of Riyadh, architecture of the
        Apocalypse that's really just the roof of an indoor pool ... The President reading his war poem, invoking FDR, JFK,
        even the Great Communicator ...

        It's a familiar feast, all fragments and repetition stuck together with a paste of groundless spec. And of course it's

        the R&amp;D Freeway; forget the gridiron action of the Battling Sidewinders, the sailing and windsurf‌ing on Congress
        Lake, and the hundred and one golf courses of the West Hills; forget the nightlife, the f‌ine Mexican eateries and
        barbecue pits of the south side, the East Main drag with its honkytonks and beer joints; and while you're at it, all
        right, go ahead and forget the Just Say No Cafe.

        Leaving aside all these considerable attractions, there is still one great inducement to visit the capitol city of Tara —
        that gorgeous jewel of nature we call Whitman's Creek.
    </div>

    <div title="Meet the Creek">
        Thea Agnew pushed back the gate. "Miles Macarthur of Brooklyn, I'd like you to meet Whitman's Creek." She
        meant it as a formal introduction. Though she was only a transplanted Taran, Thea had been around the place long
        enough to develop a native's reverence for the Creek.

        Most folks picked it up fairly quick, often on their f‌irst visit. You stopped thinking of Whitman's Creek as a place,
        you recognized it as a presence, a living thing. Call it romanticism if you must but remember that it's taken very
        seriously around here. <analepsis>In 1973 the City Council actually passed an ordnance in defense of the Creek's civil rights.
        The High Court of the Commonwealth quashed the act as unconstitutional, but no one dared call it frivolous.</analepsis>

        "Well, hi there, Creek," Miles responded.
    </div>

    <div title="Anomaly">
        Strictly speaking the Creek consisted of a quarter mile of astonishingly pure spring water f‌lowing through a
        limestone basin of remarkable beauty.

        It was one of Creation's great swimming holes, set in the rolling riverside hills south of the city, encircled by live
        oaks and prairie grass, home to grackles, warblers, bullfrogs and occasional deer. The lucid waters of the Creek,
        which held a constant 68 degrees throughout the year, welcomed hundreds of Tarans each day — the young and
        the old, the black, brown, and white: politicians and professors, students of life, beggarmen and thieves. They
        swam, they basked, they hung out peaceably in the gentle atmosphere that prevailed.

        It wasn't anything your urban easterner could deal with.
    </div>

    <div title="Miles in Nature">
        <prolepsis>"This is, like, nature," Miles said, sniff‌ing. He was somewhere past diffident and headed straight for wary.

        "It's some kind of lovely," Harley said, looking out over all that sparkling water.

        "Nature is, like, wet," Miles observed, dipping in part of a toe. "It could get all over you."

        "That's the concept," Thea told him.

        Veronica loped around to the deep end and took a quick plunge, body-conscious and anxious to avoid display —
        though of course the pale f‌lash of her dive turned heads all along the line of sight. All except for Thea, who looked
        away. She toyed with her bowling shirt, summoned her gumption, shucked it of‌f and made an elegant entry, slipping
        in with barely a ripple. Harley pinched his nostrils and followed feet-f‌irst.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Coming In?">
        <prolepsis>Veronica broke surface just below Macarthur's f‌ishwhite toes, which were wiggling nervously. She sucked in a
        breath, her shoulders breaching and sinking to the rhythm of her slow kick. "Coming in, Miles?"

        "In," Miles repeated. He glanced down at himself. <analepsis>Somehow they had inveigled him into a pair of Urquhart's
        bathing trunks,</analepsis> these enormous baggies which seemed to be, well, enameled with day-glo images of 747s, ocean
        liners, stretch limousines, machine pistols, and other tokens of American Af‌fluence as seen by a Chinese
        pieceworker. Miles wasn't sure he wanted to know what the suit looked like once it got wet.

        "Come on," Thea chided. "Don't be bashful now." Which around these parts was something of a rallying cry, you
        see. Pretty soon there was a spontaneous cheering section assembled there in the deep end of the Creek, a dozen or
        more citizens exhorting Miles to Just Do It.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Splashdown">
        <prolepsis>"Folks bathe together 'round these parts."
        "Don't be a stranger."
        "Come on guy, get wet!"

        So what were you going to do, let all these nice people down? Macarthur spread his arms and offered himself to
        nature. He hit the water more or less broadside, making a very big splash. A general cheer went up from the crowd
        as Miles came up blowing and snorting. The water did indeed feel wonderf‌ul. It even tasted good.

        "What do you think?" Thea asked.

        "It's amazing," Miles testified.

        "That's nice," a woman in a black tank suit called over, "enjoy it while you can."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="While You Can">
        <prolepsis>Veronica kicked off and backstroked over to the woman who'd just spoken. "What did you mean by that?" she
        asked, treading water.

        "Guess you didn't see the paper this morning," the woman told her. "This big developer bought 75 acres just
        upstream of here. Wants to put in a golf course and luxury condos. Read all about it," she advised, "then get real
        mad." She turned and headed for the shallows.

        Miles paddled to the side and caught his breath. "Oh well," he ref‌lected, "at least this proves I'm not hallucinating.
        We're still in America as we know it."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Fertile Subject">
        <prolepsis>Harley wasn't following this. "Okay, yet another golf course," he said. "Horribly redundant, yeah, but what's it got
        to do with the Creek? What are folks scared of, getting zapped by a wild drive from the sixteenth tee? Or could it be
        the au naturel crowd worried about peepers from the Moral Majority?"

        Thea sluiced water in his face. "Guess again, Geraldo."

        Veronica joined in, catching him in a cross-splash. "Wake up and smell the shit, Harley," she chided.

        "Actually," Miles pointed out, "it might be more accurate to say fertilizer."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Up the Creek">
        <prolepsis>The four of them climbed reluctantly out of the water and parked themselves under an old sycamore. "Golf courses
        aren't what you'd call a regular geologic feature," Miles explained to Harley.

        "Right," Thea joined in. "To keep one going in this part of the world you need three things: cheap labor, plenty of
        water, and a few tons of chemical fertilizer."

        "Guess where it all goes when it runs of‌f?" Veronica said, tugging his earlobes.

        "Ah."

        "Actually, runoff from the construction alone would probably devastate this here swimming hole," Miles estimated.
        "What washes of‌f the back nine would pretty much ensure it stayed that way. To say nothing of ef‌fluent from the
        sewer or septic systems they'd need for the condos."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="With a Bullet">
        <prolepsis>"Whose bright idea was this?" Veronica demanded. Her back was stif‌f with rage. "And where does he live?"

        "Mark for a soft-nosed bullet," Thea considered. "You've got an idea there, only I hope you get your bullets by the
        gross. This scam is the worst kind of fucking with Mother Nature, but there seems to be a whole lot of
        motherf‌uckers in them thar hills."

        "Pretty well dug in, too, I'd guess," Miles added.

        Veronica sat with f‌ists clenched in her lap. "Somebody has to do something."

        Harley covered those tight f‌ists with his hand. "I'll make a trip to the County Building do a little rototilling of the
        records, we'll see what connects with what." Veronica shook her head, still ridden by her fury.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Et Voila">
        <prolepsis>But don't forget that it's a magical place, Whitman's Creek. The extreme improbability of its beauty seems to testify
        that really anything is possible, even on this blasted and increasingly dumped-over rock.

        Which (one can hope) goes at least partway toward explaining what happened right after Veronica voiced that
        demand for action. Call it wish fulf‌illment.

        To the our four visitors it all came down as a sudden whirl of sensations, disjointed and unreal, one more case of life
        imitating drugs. Though really there was a rational explanation for almost everything and the leftovers could be
        handed of‌f to unreason.

        Anyway, there was this helicopter.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Something Happens">
        <prolepsis>The whipbeat of rotor blades getting suddenly very close and then this big crazy wind rushes down and
        everybody's grabbing for clothes, backpacks, purses, picnic baskets, loose kids who run whooping headlong
        through the chaos like it's their natural element because, what do you know, it is.

        "Local TV," Harley yelled over the turbine scream. "These fuckers'll do anything for a story." He scooped up a
        stray softball and pitched it toward the hovering aircraft, a Jet Ranger belonging to Tara's own Channel 12. It was a
        good try but the chopper dodged.

        "What’s he trying to shoot?" Miles wondered, trying to extrapolate from the angle of the skycam mount.

        But even in all the noise and confusion it soon became clear what the TV crew was after.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Well In Hand">
        <prolepsis>All the interest seemed to be down at the shallow end of the swimming hole, the end adjoining the property slated
        for development. A small knot of protesters had climbed over a fence down there, a few dozen at most, wearing
        telegenic T-shirts and bandanas and carrying signs that read "Up the Creek," "Eat My Nine Iron," and "Whitman
        Had The Right Idea." A couple of Parks Department people were on the scene but at the moment they weren't
        interfering. They seemed caught up in the spectacle.

        And indeed there was a spectacle here, something rare and tasty to shoot for the dinner table. It wasn't the
        protesters that the f‌lying eye wanted — it was that f‌igure standing out in front of them, the fellow with the
        moustache, sunglasses, and heavily cleft chin, the guy in the strange military drag, the one now stepping to the
        water's edge and reaching for his—

        "Oh Jesus they won't show that Live At Five," Macarthur predicted.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="The Prophet Returns">
        <prolepsis>The man at the water's edge was evidently ambidextrous, or at least capable of managing two things at once. While
        his left hand was engaged (along with other parts of his anatomy) in symbolic demonstration, he used his right to
        hoist up a battery-powered megaphone and make this little speech.

        PEOPLES OF TARA. THE ONE AND ONLY GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THIS LOVELY JEWEL YET YOU WOULD SEE
        IT TURNED INTO A PUBLIC SEWER — JUST AS EVEN NOW YOUR INFIDEL ARMIES VIOLATE THE PURITY OF
        THE HOLY DESERT.

        THE PROPHET UQBARI HAS COME TO SHOW YOU THE SHAME OF YOUR OFFENSE. BEHOLD, I MAKE
        WATER IN YOUR POOL. MAY IT SHOW YOU THE WAY TO CLEANLINESS. PEACE BE UPON YOU.

        And having uttered these words the prophet buttoned up, dropped his megaphone, and leapt into the bushes.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Ubi Sunt">
        Dear Emily | It seems true, as you always suspected, that my mind is not
        right. How can I tell you this? Now that you're halfway around the world,
        now that your life is so deep in difficulties, now that so much is at risk
        for you and for us. Maybe this is not meant for you after all, Emily, maybe
        I'm just talking to myself again. Talking to myself: something's the matter
        with U. It's not just <analepsis>the old narcissism and depression</analepsis> but something new
        and quite frightening. Harley tells U about a nightmare in which he
        conceives a body identical to his own, yet not his own | maybe it comes from
        watching himself too many times on tape. U has never been on the tube but
        he understands the problem: when he looks in the mirror he too does not see
        himself but another, or to be accurate one of the others. There seem to be
        quite a few, shimmering around him and swarming through him. U gets these
        fits, starting out as ordinary vertigo with the racing pulse and the sudden
        catch in his brain like the rush of dope or the stroke of some great Idea |
        but this time it's something alien, altogether outside his ken. He feels
        distributed, disseminated, broadcast. U seem in this moment to exist in
        home than one place and time.

    <div title="Know About That">
        Listening to those voices in his head, like this one says I AM A SCIENTIST
        EMILY YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT ME. No visionary, no mystic, no shaman. <analepsis>U used
        to imagine playing God's Fool but those scenes were never really in the
        picture.</analepsis> That was mere foolishness, low delusion, simple sentimental
        paranoia. Indeed he is what he has striven to be: the Scientist, the Man In
        The White Suit, what U know about that? What can anyone know about
        anything? O man, spare us these Questions. Why not, what are any of U but
        questions? Knowledge arises out of complex discursive transactions. What
        can we (say we) know that doesn't implicate us in inquiries about the
        process by which (we say) we come to know that which (we say) we have come
        to know? What U say? Knowledge comprises itself in complex recursive
        interactions. We make it up as we make it up, more-than-half-creating that
        which we perceive. And this is news? No of course not it's the oldest hat
        on the rack: epistemodoxy, finest ground, the very Unstuff on which we prop
        our nonbelief. And so here we sit in this po' moment, two reels deep in the
        Return of the Twilight of the Idols, and what we know above all is that we
        are but shadows here, poor players. But really, folks, ya gotta love this

        world as a vast and perpetual conflict of paranoias" (yeah, but he was
        wrong, all the time it was this great big laundry truck ...) A little
        paranoia never hurt anyone, Tate insinuates, nor for that matter a whole
        lot. What makes you think of me as paranoid? Could be the way everyone
        spends his time plotting against you. If they are, I explain, it's because
        you put them up to it. Let me tell you about my vision, Tate relates, a
        vision of the End of History. Soon to be a major motion fixture, sez I,
        with Ronald Reagan as Charlton Heston and NBC as God. All the experience of
        humankind, Tate crates, is a huge cosmic riddle whose answer is | Hurry up
        please it's | Don't interrupt: whose answer is Something Out Of Nothing, or
        the becomingness of being. Gosh, I wouldn't have guessed in a billion
        years. Nor is this vast achievement complete. Tate estimates, for we have
        only now entered into the age of autonomous and self-modifying simulacra,
        the moment of convergence between the IS and the COULD BE. Which is where
        you come in. HE? sez I. That's right, Tate stipulates, U must engineer a
        System | or be enraged by another man's. Hang on, I protest, I got this
        terrible Swarming Sensation...

    <div title="A New Refutation of Time">
        By my scientific reckoning, Emily, <analepsis>we have given our bodies to each other

        reason you put aside what I would call fulfillment. But my maleness is a
        fatal handicap. I know the shape of my desires: don't worry son just follow
        that Arrow and the rest comes naturally. For me, not for you. Emily, the
        way you are in sex remains a wonder to me, something alien and apart | but
        desired, for that reason, beyond all measure. When I lie with you I pass

        worry son just follow that Arrow and the rest comes naturally. For me, not
        for you.
    </div>

    <div title="Ancient History">
        "What exactly did you do in the antiwar movement, Mom?"

        Gad, thought Thea, another one of those Wisdom Questions. What did you do in the war, Daddy? What was it like
        in the Great Depression? — Well, sonny, things were a lot different then, heh heh... It made her feel ancient. What
        could be next, she wondered — menopause, grandchildren? But Leroy had meant the question honestly, and it was
        true, she'd never told him the details.

        "I didn't do much. I went along on some marches and got a faceful of tear gas. Mostly I just carried signs and
        helped arrange transport and food for people. I did slip a lot of school in the process."

        "Hmm."

        "Yeah, well, it wasn't costing any ten grand, remember."
    </div>

    <div title="Radical Mom">
        <prolepsis>"Were you ever arrested?" Leroy wanted to know.

        "Jesus what is this, an FBI interview? No I was never arrested, not once, not even on Moratorium Day when Nixon
        popped half of Washington, D.C. without due process. Commit that one to memory: unconstitutional arrests;
        massive violations of civil rights."

        Leroy made obedient scribbling motions. "Yes ma'am, got it, he was a crook after all. But what about you, you're
        telling me you never did anything really outrageous?"

        Thea eyed her son narrowly. "Why do I suspect your father's hand in this little inquisition?"

        The boy did his best to look innocent. "I was just curious about why you got thrown out of college."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not a War Story">
        <prolepsis>"Okay, if you have to know. I was expelled from Bryn Mawr after I punched out the head of the Chemistry
        Department."

        Leroy looked appreciative. "Did you really?"

        Thea lit another cigarette and shook out the match. "Left hook. I really cleaned the poor man's clock"

        Leroy tried to reconstruct the action, carrying her left fist up to his own jaw. He shook his head disbelievingly.
        "Why'd you do it, Mom?"

        Thea f‌lushed. "I'm so glad you got around to that, kiddo — this isn't one of your Grandpa Agnew's war stories,
        remember. It turns out I did it for no good reason at all."

        "Say what?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Violent Mistake">
        <prolepsis>"Like most violent acts," Thea explained, "there was no justif‌ication. I was standing on a streetcorner reading some
        kind of poster. I think it was for a women's rights rally. Doctor Nagel came by and I thought he said to me, 'Don't
        believe everything you read, girlie.' So I turned around and let him have it."

        "Pow, right in the kisser."

        "I'm not proud of this, Roy."

        "Yeah, okay, maybe you overreacted. But the man was being a sexist asshole, right?"

        "Wrong. Nagel wasn't talking to me, he was talking to the man standing next to him, a guy called Charles Earlie.
        And they were talking about somebody's polymer research, not about the rally."

        "Whoops."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Out of School">
        <prolepsis>"They really threw you out, huh?"

        "On my ass, and irrevocably. Folks were getting expelled right and lef‌t those days and most of them got to come
        back af‌ier a year or two on the straight. But somehow the College couldn't manage to forgive me. Young ladies
        weren't supposed to be quick with their f‌ists."

        "Gee, Mom. Did you ever beat up on Dad?"

        She gave him the narrowest of glares.

        "Joshing, really." He put up his hands and mimed some counterpunches. "So af‌ier Bryn Mawr you spent a few
        years hanging out, right?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="BMTV">
        <prolepsis>"'Hanging out?'" Thea repeated. "Not unless union organizing, voter registration, and running a community clinic
        count as 'hanging out.' Jesus Christ, kid, you make it sound like nonstop sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll."

        "Sorry, Mom. I forgot you lived in the days before MTV."

        "You get more like your father all the time."

        "It’s in my jeans." Leroy padded out to the fridge and snagged another Corona, only to see it conf‌iscated as soon
        as he got back to the sofa. It was worth a try. "So if you were doing all this good for the world, Mom, how come
        you went back to school? How'd you end up a college professor anyway?"

        Now there was a good question.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Post-60's">
        <prolepsis>Thea went to the kitchen and poured the interdict beer down the disposer, removing temptations. She felt a little
        dizzy, mainly from the bourbon but partly from the company. <analepsis>She almost hadn't recognized him this time, he'd grown
        so much — but once he started talking there could be no mistake.</analepsis> He was still Leroy the surprising boy, growing up
        as fast as he could, challenging her to make the world make sense.

        Why <analepsis>had she gone back to school?</analepsis> Why hadn't she taken her law degree after the divorce? She thought she had
        answers. She went back into the living room and lay down on the sofa, propping her heels on Leroy's bony knees.

        "I went back to school because I believed in what was happening there," Thea told him. "You've heard this word
        'counterculture,' right? Among other things, it meant an ability to criticize the existing culture — its history, its
        values, its imagination. An ability to see a difference and make a dif‌ference."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Bildung">
        <prolepsis>"Let me get this right," Leroy interpreted, "you thought you could teach your way to a better country."

        Thea thought it over. "Yeah," she said. "Laugh if you will, but that's essentially it."

        "Gee, Mom. Do you still believe that?"

        Thea closed her eyes. It was almost a full minute before she said anything and for a while Leroy thought she might
        have lapsed into sleep.

        "Yes I do," she said f‌inally. "I do still believe it. How about you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="On Schedule">
        <prolepsis>Leroy scratched his ringlets for a while. "I don't know," he said, it's a strange place out there in America."

        "It's always been that, love."

        "And now they're talking about another war. Y'know, Mom, most of the people I talked to seem to think it's on some
        kind of goddam schedule — like it was a TV special."

        "Pretty scary, isn't it?" She sat up and crossed her legs. "But what do you do with that fear, Roy? Do you just walk
        on down the street f‌iguring 'I'm OK' and hope it doesn't get too bad? Or do you try to change the way things are?
        Do you think that change is possible?"

        He thought it over. "Maybe. I just don't see how to make it happen."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Telephone">
        On the very twitch of midnight Thea's telephone began to ring. Thea didn't move. She didn't even hear the f‌irst ring,
        or if she did, she gave no response.

        In the darkened house the phone rang again.

        It might have been a friendly call from someone on the Committee, or from Harley or Miles Macarthur or even
        Urquhart; it might have been any number of old friends from back east calling to share the war shock; it might have
        been just a wrong number. But somehow Thea was convinced this call would be none of the above. Some deeper
        sense told her this call was trouble.
    </div>

    <div title="Ringing Tone">
        <prolepsis>The telephone was ringing.

        Veronica felt the sound reach under the ribs, tightening a knot of tension there. Given what had already gone down
        here and abroad, she shared Thea's foreboding. She closed her eyes and sat still, thinking of another phone call,
        perhaps not so far in her future, that she might not want to answer.

        The phone rang. There was a little red lamp on the instrument that pulsed in time to the ringing tone. It bathed the
        kitchen in strobe light, making inert surfaces seem to dance.

        Leroy got up and stood by the telephone, wondering what next, where do we go from here? He reached for the
        handset but hesitated.

        The phone rang.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Listeners">
        <prolepsis>Thea walked out into the kitchen and picked up the receiver. She listened a while, talked back, then listened some
        more, talked back some more.

        She went into what sounded like an involved conversation. Her voice rose and fell. At f‌irst she sounded diff‌ident
        and cold, then wary, then angry, then agitated. She wrapped the phone cord around her forearm and twisted.
        Leroy and Veronica watched and listened, trying to imagine the whole conversation from what they heard on their
        end. Who was on the line? What was happening?

        Thea set the phone back in its cradle, shaking her head. She began to laugh.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Caller">
        <analepsis>Hello?

        Dorothea Agnew. I think you know who this is.

        At any other time she might have been surprised, but what was one more bizarre improbability on a night when the
        whole world was going mad?

        It was Heidel himself. She pictured him on the dartboard of her mind, the modest academic f‌igure never out of sober
        coat and tie, the big, shaggy, empty head, the jowly face with its scowl of permanent grievance. Bullseye.

        What could he want? He'd never called before, in fact he hadn't spoken a dozen words to her in all the years they'd
        both been at Tara. She twisted the phone cord and felt her mind go f‌lying.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Unhappy">
        <prolepsis>You're uncharacteristically quiet, Prof‌essor Agnew. I don't suppose you're happy to hear f‌rom me.

        I don't suppose I am.

        Thea felt her neck beginning to prickle. She was overcome by that uncomfortable sensation we get on entering the
        penumbra of someone else's conspiracy. Wheels turning in her head, making up machinations, plot and counterplot.
        What was Heidel up to? What might be going on?

        And why now, why tonight? There was some connection, obviously, to the f‌ireworks in the desert, but what could
        it be?</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Adjectival">
        <prolepsis>Well that makes no diff‌erence, really. I don't think much of you and you don't think much of me, that's probably
        the one thing we can agree on.

        Probably.

        <fid>Self-righteous overbearing pompous ignorant parochial racist sexist ambitious manipulating ass-kissing unprincipled
        two-faced cowardly resentful sleazy foolish hateful. For starters.</fid>

        And how, Thea wondered, did Heidel see her?

        <fid>Narrow-minded nihilistic profane subversive disloyal irrational scheming sharp-tongued clever undignif‌ied sluttish
        brazen vindictive power-hungry vicious.</fid> Yeah.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Business">
        <prolepsis>Did you have something to discuss or is this call just harrassment, plain and simple?

        Please, Professor Agnew. I wouldn't interrupt your evening unless I had very urgent business to discuss, which I
        assure you I do.

        That plotted-against feeling washed over her again. She was seized by practical paranoia: a disquieting awareness
        of the many bad things that could happen in the toils of a conspiracy. Her mind swarmed with visions of herself in a
        number of untenable positions, moral, political and even physical. None of them would have been quite so bad
        taken alone, but together they were intolerable.

        She wished she knew what Heidel had up his sleeve.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Proposition">
        <prolepsis>I have a proposition to put to you, Professor Agnew.

        I'll bet you do.

        Please, I'm not joking. Consider this carefully.

        Proposition? What could this mean? A deal of some kind — or more likely some sort of strong-arm action.

        The only operative questions, she decided, were what he could threaten and whether he could make good.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Courteous">
        <prolepsis>I promise you, it's only out of courtesy that I'm calling tonight.

        How kind of you.

        <fid>Courteous, kind, obedient, cheeful. Heidel the Eagle Scout, though she doubted he'd had that much initiative.
        Courtesy: give a lady her due, show some respect there's a laugh. Heidel you're a patronizing two-faced sexist
        bastard on top of everything else. Bend over and put your courtesy back where it belongs.</fid>

        But it came to her chillingly that Heidel seemed unusually magnanimous and full of himself — which meant that he
        felt ready to deal some really high-handed blow.

        What was coming?</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Demand">
        <prolepsis>What's this proposition of yours?

        Resign as chair of the Revised Curriculum Committee. Allow Tate to replace you with someone both of us would
        regard as moderate or ideologically neutral.

        <fid>Well, was that all? Sure you don't want me to hand you my wallet and carkeys while we're at it? Pay off your
        mortgage? Serve up a six-course dinner? Drop my pants and pretend to enjoy it?</fid>

        Maybe, she tried to convince herself, he's temporarily lost his reason. Maybe he's just sitting there with an
        enormous mental hardon because of the war news and he's lost all sense of proportion. Maybe he's had one too
        many valium, or he's drunk.

        He didn't sound drunk.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Bad Shit">
        <prolepsis>I'd laugh but I'm not sure it's f‌unny. Have you lost your mind, Heidel?

        I'm quite sane and I'm not joking, Thea.

        <fid>No he wasn't, but surely he ought to be. Unless something was grotesquely wrong. Thea.

        Heidel on a f‌irst-name basis? He was patronizing, yes. Doing it to antagonize? — no, that didn't make sense. Heidel
        was too big a coward to come spoiling for a f‌ight. Anyone knew that to patronize Thea Agnew was to goad her, and
        Heidel wouldn't goad unless he felt sure of winning. Or unless he'd already won.</fid>

        Her head spun a little. <fid>This could be bad shit, Thea.</fid></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Background Fill">
        <prolepsis>Okay, cut the bullshit, Heidel. What makes you think I'd take this ultimatum of yours seriously for even a second?

        Excuse me, there's no call f‌or profanity. And as for a reason, that should be obvious — consider tonight's events
        in the middle east.

        And she could hear it there behind him, as he sat there in his study or his windowless attic or his belltower or
        wherever he skulked OK to when he made his venomous phone calls. He had the TV going, as who didn't tonight,
        but it sounded as if he'd just given the volume a deliberate boost. He wanted her to hear.

        So maybe <analepsis>her vision</analepsis> wasn't so inaccurate, that picture of Heidel drunk with all our global bullying, stiff-pricked from
        watching the pornography of airstrikes. Rat-fucking fascist bastard, she thought. But no, Thea, profanity is not
        called for here. Profanity won't even begin to discharge the rage.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Ask the Man">
        <prolepsis>Gee, Erich, I'd just love to give you my views on the war, but it's late and you don't like to hear me say things like
        babykilling dickhead militarist motherfuckers, so why bother? Just tell me this — what does the war have to do
        with my Curriculum Committee?

        0h, a lot, just an awful lot. Ask Tate.

        Well, Thea thought, at least I know now where he's laid his ambush. Tate: he'd gone over her head to the Provost —
        on the whole, pretty predictable behavior from such as Heidel.

        Nor, now that she thought about it, was betrayal something unexpected from a Provost, who after all was one of
        those Big Men standing up there on the sacrif‌icial pyramid holding the obsidian knife of his office. Somehow she'd
        expected more from Tate, but it wouldn't be the f‌irst time she'd been sold out.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Letters">
        <prolepsis>What are you trying to tell me, Tate's decided that our Western Civ revision is a threat to national security?

        Oh hardly. Though for myself, I think what you've proposed to do is part of a process aimed at undermining the
        moral education of an entire generation.

        Save your paranoia Heidel. Let's feed mine for a minute. Just tell me why you think Tate's going to put the knife
        in my back.

        Oh, it probably has to do with the letters.

        Letters? Her mind was off and running through the possibilities: intercepted correspondence — real, forged,
        distorted — belonging to her, the Committee, or Jesus please not to Urquhart — containing embarrassments
        conpiratorial, political, erotic. Whose letters? What letters?</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Two or Three Thousand">
        <prolepsis>What letters?

        Oh, the ones written in by alumni, students, and parents of service personnel in the Gulf. The ones that point out
        that this is a time requiring national unity and a sense of common purpose. The ones that urge Tate to reconsider
        curricular changes that divide the faculty, alienate the taxpayers, and place the University in the glare of
        national controversy.

        How many of these letters are we talking about?

        0h, two or three thousand, max.

        <fid>You had to hand it to him. As ratfucking went, this was a genuine coup.</fid></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="People Power">
        <prolepsis>Two or three thousand. Mimeographed, by any chance, in the of‌fices of the Educational Freedom Foundation?

        0h heavens no. We just bought ourselves a high-speed printer. Part of our new grant from the Braithwaite Fund.

        Thea had never heard of the Braithwaite Fund but it was no surprise that the New Right had deep pockets. How
        could she respond? — mobilize her cadres of committed twenty-year-olds to organize demonstrations, picket and sit
        in, at least to mount their own letter-writing campaign...

        Except that she had no cadres. Except that there probably weren't three hundred citizens of Tara, let alone three
        thousand, who'd write in. <fid>Power to the people.

        Which means you win, Heidel — except maybe he hadn't.</fid></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Why Bother?">
        <prolepsis>Well gee, Erich, what can I say? If you're in such a strong position why even bother offering me a deal? Why not
        just have Tate appoint you to chair the Committee?

        Silence on the line.

        Okay, Thea decided, this is still a contest. <fid>Whatever his politics, institutional or otherwise, Tate had no affection for
        Erich Heidel. It was well known. He must have cut his own deal with Heidel and his pressure group.

        But what would the terms of this deal have been?</fid></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="String Attached">
        <prolepsis>The Provost thought it best that the new chair of the Committee come f‌rom outside the Humanities, and that he be
        allied with no political faction.

        Of course he did. And what else did he think?

        There was another longish pause. Well, actually he has a candidate in mind. Someone he thinks both of us ought
        to be able to agree upon.

        "Ought to," Thea ref‌lected, as in "must or else no deal." A stipulation, a string attached. Well, you didn't get to the
        top of the pyramid by caving in under threats, did you? Tate was a better schemer than she thought, and evidently
        Heidel's three thousand points of light would only take him so far.

        She set out to unwrap the f‌inal surprise. She gave Tate's string a little pull.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Unity Candidate">
        <prolepsis>And who would this unity candidate be?

        Well... I warn you, it's obviously someone neither of us would have chosen. Someone we'd both regard as
        unsuitable, though not necessarily because of his views. To be f‌lank, Tate's trying to play games here.

        <fid>As if you're not.</fid>

        So who is it?

        Boris Urquhart.

        Thea nearly dropped the phone.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Postwar">
        <!-- Unreadable diagram -->
    </div>

    <div title="Morning">
        Thea comes to me this morning full of demands and schemes, <analepsis>all that funk and lethargy</analepsis> f‌inally behind her. We need
        to rethink the chapter on postmodern politics. Have I read Haraway on situated knowledge yet? Why won't her
        Macintosh boot from the external hard drive? Do these shorts show too much derriére, and do I really care?

        I think it means something, this sudden abundance of energy. I think it means she's beginning to accommodate
        herself, to accept her place in the sun. Waking up Californian — sooner or later it happens to all of us.

        She sits on my deck wearing some of Alastair's old shades, reading last week's Chronicle and doing a sort of
        play-by-play. I've never met anyone for whom academic culture seemed so much like professional wrestling.

        My day starts well when she comes.
    </div>

    <div title="Noon">
        <prolepsis>Midday and I need focusing. My mind won't stay on the subject. I have a head full of budget cuts and the job
        market. So I go out to walk in the redwoods and next thing I know I'm turning up her path, I'm picking up her mail, I'm
        at her door.

        I f‌ind her in the swimming pool. "It's the middle of the day. You're going native," I tell her.

        She puts her head out and does a slow breast stroke. "I'm beginning to feel like I've always belonged in this place."

        "But don't you miss Tara?"

        She goes back under, her head turned. I don't know whether she didn't hear me or chose not to hear. I watch her
        swim an underwater lap, strong and smooth.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Night">
        <prolepsis>"I haven't had a cigarette in three and a half weeks," she tells me. We're sitting on the deck looking at Venus up
        there, brighter than any airliner.

        I tell her that's wonderful, I'm truly jealous. I've quit three times so far but can't manage to stay the course. I ask her
        how she managed, where she found the strength, and she tells me it was probably the move: she feels renewed,
        made over into a different woman. New attitudes, new memories.

        "Do you miss Tara?" I ask again.

        "Some," she tells me. "The people, the food, the beer. And maybe the cactus."

        It's been more than a year, I observe, and she's never brought the subject up. It's something she'd rather put behind
        her.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Breakfast">
        <prolepsis>I've never been much into breakfast. Maybe it's a rejection of all that Kellogg's-Best-to-You programming, maybe it
        follows from my decision to live alone. I can't really face food f‌irst thing in the morning. Best just to pass me my
        carafe of coffee then back off to a safe distance till I look reasonably human.

        I'd forgotten what it's like to be sixteen. Roy has just devoured two bowls of granola, three eggs over easy, a small
        honeydew, and the other half of Thea's bran muff‌in. Washed down with a pint of orange juice and the obligatory

        "It used to go into growth hormones," his mother observes. "Lately it's more the other kind."

    <div title="Lunch">
        <prolepsis>"I always thought sushi was, like, raw f‌ish," Leroy observes between mouthfuls.

        "That's sashimi," I explain. "Though you'll f‌ind the odd bit of tuna in there if you look." At the rate he's going there
        isn't time to look, which is a shame really. This is art food, not your usual processed eatstuf‌f.

        "Roy's been culturally deprived," Thea apologizes.

        Ever attentive, Leroy sees an opening. "Say, Mom, could I spend next summer in Tokyo?"

        "No. Why?"

        He gives her the standard you don't get it, do you look. "VR, of course."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Dinner">
        <prolepsis>"He's a wonderful kid," I tell her. "You did real well."

        Thea's trying not to look at him over across the room, trying to schmooze with our waitress. She's from the college,
        blonde, athletic, gorgeous, eighteen. A distance swimmer. She smiles at him a lot, probably thinks he's cute and
        even exotic. I will not tell him that she's gay.

        "Roy will do okay," Thea says. "He's got a lot of time to grow up."

        "He's a fast starter."

        She pushes away the last bite of her lasagna. Somehow we both know where it will end up. "You'd better start fast
        these days," Thea says. "Otherwise the ground has a way of moving out from under you."</prolepsis>

    <div title="At Work">
        <prolepsis>Work on our book goes slowly, it's a protracted struggle, labor in every sense of the word. We live no more than
        two miles apart, a short walk and a shorter bike ride, but lately we do most of our work over the computer. Thea
        sends me a draf‌t, I read it and think about it, then we link up on a chat line and negotiate at the keyboard. Somehow
        it keeps us focused. Distraction is always a problem.

    </div>

    <div title="At Play">
        <prolepsis>I touch her very lightly but in just the right place and she says "Yes — oh yes" and catches f‌ire, wrapping her
        thighs around my arm, sinking her nails in my shoulders and holding me very close. "That's so, so lovely," she
        says, lying across my chest. I can feel the stirrings inside her.

        "Nice to hear it." I'm lying back contentedly, my body still glowing. "You know, most women aren't nearly so
        vocal."

        "The more fools they." She shifts a little and we both sigh, then start to laugh. "Y'know, I wasn't always like this. I
        used to be all business, just do-it-and-get-it-done." She lies quiet for a while, recollecting. "I think it was Harley
        Morgan who made the difference. There was something about him... somehow I could talk back, communicate. I
        learned how to scream. I used to scare the shit out of him." And again we're laughing.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="In Dreams">
        <prolepsis>She wakes me later that night, or actually in the small hours of the morning. It's happened before. She's been
        dreaming. I roll over to the nightstand and pour us a drink. We share the glass.

        "It was a wedding," she tells me. "Only it took place in a huge auditorium, on this gigantic stage. I want to call it a
        'sound stage.' Everyone was wearing costumes from some opera. Aida or something like that. Only I've never seen
        Aida."

        I stroke her temple. "It's culture," I explain. "You don't have to have seen it."

        "The groom was Harley." She smiled. "You should have seen him. He was beautiful. And... the father of the bride
        was... oh Jesus it was Boris Urquhart."

        "Which means the bride wasn't Veronica," I noted. "She must have been Emily."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Then">
        <prolepsis>It's 3:17 a.m. and she's awake again. I can hear her down in the living room leaf‌ing through a magazine. I go down
        and lie on the couch with her, my head in her lap. "Was it the same dream?" This time it's she who strokes my head.

        She nods. I notice fresh tear trails along her cheekbones.

        "Did you love her?" I ask. I'm looking into her face but she won't meet my eyes.

        "Lots of people loved her," she says. "They still do."

        I put my cheek against her thigh, stroking the underside of her breast. "More to the point, did she love you?" But
        as soon as I say it I wish I hadn't, because it makes her cry.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="And Now">
        <prolepsis>She's with me now, sleeping over every night until the draft is done. In two days she's off to London for a
        conference. I'll miss her intensely.

        I think we're into a good thing. We share easily, we know what we're trying to accomplish, we seem to work better
        together than we do on our own. We have a lot of laughs. Maybe this thing goes further, maybe it all blows apart
        somehow. We don't talk about it; Thea says we're too old for that kind of anxiety, though I'm not quite her age. I'd
        call it enchantment, myself, but then I'm the sentimental one.

        Jealousy is clearly out of place here, but I do have my moments. When that dream of hers comes back, for instance.
        When Emily's been hovering about our bed. It isn't as if I don't have my own visitors dropping in from time to time
        — sometimes in the f‌lesh as well as out of memory. I don't begrudge Thea her sense of loss, her mourning. It's just
        hard to accept that I can't make it good, I can't repair the absence.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="And Then Again">
        <prolepsis>We're cleaning up Thea's study, part of the process of packing her for the London trip. Sorting through the endless
        stacks of paper, xeroxes and of‌fprints, drafts and markups, dogeared books and journals, clips friends have sent,
        letters opened but unanswered. It takes us the better part of an uncharacteristically gray Sunday but at last we've
        made some real progress. She can boast that unheard of thing for an academic, a clear desktop. "Get the Polaroid," I
        kid her.

        I pick up the big calendar we salvaged from the bottom of the heap and square it up neatly on Thea's desk, thinking
        now you're all ready to face the future. Only then do I realize that it's last year’s calendar, untouched since February,
        1991. I start to say something but then my eye catches another detail. <analepsis>Using a razorblade, someone has sliced the
        square for February 26 out of the page.</analepsis> The cut was deep, taking several other days with it.

        I say nothing.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Mourning">
        Thea comes to me today full of plans and demands, <analepsis>all that gloom and depression</analepsis> behind her at last. We need to
        rewrite the chapter on orgasmic narrative. Have I reread Haraway on situated knowledge yet? Why won't her
        Macintosh boot from the external hard drive? Do I still have that Sandra Bernhard video?

        I think it means something, this sudden resurgence of energy. I think it means she's beginning to be at home here, to
        accept her place in the sun. Waking up in California — sooner or later we all do.

        She sits on my deck wearing one of my old f‌loppy hats, reading last week's Chronicle and doing a sort of
        blow-by-blow description. I've never met anyone for whom academic culture seemed so much like a blood sport.

        My mornings aren't the same without her.
    </div>

    <div title="Miles">
        Thea's friend Mi‌les Macarthur drives in from Las Vegas for a conference and screening. In some unaccountable way
        he's suddenly turned into a f‌ilmmaker and he's spent the last year producing a documentary about a group of
        apocalyptic Christians who seem to have an obsession with Hollywood disaster epics. Miles has been invited to
        screen it for a "Film on Film" conference. That's appropriate, since most of Miles' footage shows people watching
        other movies. Apparently M‌iles' f‌ilm is very much admired for its technique.

        I like Mi‌les — it seems impossible not to. There's something gentle and dignif‌ied about him. He's got that Jesuit
        strain injected crosswise, but in his case it's produced something very rare, a sort of saintly cynicism.

        Apparently <analepsis>Miles was a close friend of poor Urquhart, which is how Thea met him.</analepsis> Tara is with us always.
    </div>

    <div title="Stranger">
        <prolepsis>I offer to put Miles up in my place, which has a real second bed instead of Thea's folding cot. Miles is easy to talk
        to. Like Thea, like Leroy — like Harley, come to think of it — there's something fundamentally sunny in his makeup.
        Also he shares my vice, he's incapable of human behavior till he's had at least 32 ounces of coffee in the mornings.

        We spend a lot time talking about Thea's and my book, in which he seems genuinely interested. We talk about
        Leroy and his interest in virtual realities, since this is, or used to be, Miles' business. It turns out that Miles is to a
        large extent responsible for Leroy's interest in Reality Art. Miles and Boris Urquhart.

        "What's happened to him anyway?" I ask when the name comes up. I've never met Boris, but he still seems to mean
        a lot to Thea.

        Miles shrugs. "Some people's lives are, well, stranger than others. He'll be okay."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="And...">
        <prolepsis>We're out on the deck. It's early April, there's a full moon and the Pacif‌ic is so restless and wonderful in that chalky
        light that I can't take my eyes away from it. <analepsis>Many's the spring night I've fallen asleep out here, waking up an hour or
        so before dawn, frozen half blue.</analepsis> Miles seems as deeply struck as I am, which makes me that much more fond of him.

        "And what about Emily?" I ask him suddenly. I don't mean to do it. The words just appear on my tongue, big
        surprise to both of us.

        He goes on admiring that ocean. "Well she's gone," he tells me.

        I can't think of anything adequate to say in response. "It's hard, isn't it?" is what I manage.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Anima">
        <prolepsis>"Hard, yeah." M‌iles says. "You could also say mindless, pointless, and fucked up." He turns to me, adding
        something else with his eyes. And what can you do about it?

        The silence swirls down like the coastal fog and we let it sit there for a few long minutes. Finally I speak. "Thea's
        still hurting."

        M‌iles looks at me in a way I can't read, with something in his expression that seems to be recognition. He reaches
        into his jacket pocket, digs out his sketchbook, searching for something in the f‌irst few pages. He hands me the
        book and maybe it's the moonlight, maybe it's the wine we've been drinking but I do know the face, intimately. It's a
        face I see a lot. Every morning in the bathroom mirror.

        "I did it two years ago, on a dare." Miles explains. "Emily Runbird at 35."</prolepsis>

        War is hell. Emily ref‌lected, and in hell all your clothes are made of plastic and they give you sirens to sleep by.

        "What you gonna do when you get home, Runbird?" Sergeant Yvonne asked.

        suit. But then again, Dexter was one of those lucky guys who could sneak a nap into just about any f‌ive minute
        interval. The kind best advised never to work as long-distance bus drivers.

        "Home," Emily was saying. "Home home home."

        "Soon," the Whizzer added. "Real real soon."

        Dexter threw back his hood, snapped up out of sleep. "Shut the fuck up!" he yelled. "Don't you people know

        thrown across the room, maybe. Right, she knew she'd been thrown through the air, she couldn't say how far, and
        she knew she'd landed hard because she couldn't get her breath, she didn't remember coming down but she thought
        something had happened when she did and she didn't want to move her legs. She could sort of feel them which was
        good but they felt wet and that wasn't so good. There was nothing to hear except the buzzing which was always
        the same. But it wasn't so black, there were lights f‌lickering somewhere. Maybe they were torches or maybe f‌lames.
        She didn't know if she was breathing now. She began to feel cold and that gave her a f‌lash of fear, adrenaline kicked

        Urquhart looked down the length of East Main, counting three lights dead ahead, 20th, 24th, 26Dth. All cycling now
        to amber. He checked the rearview and saw two cars behind him, an old green pickup and a blue Mercury. Short on
        trim, aggressively ordinary, entirely too off‌icial: the fabled Unmarked Car. He glanced back again as the Mercury
        passed a streetlight and saw the big head above the steering wheel, watched the driver brush his forelock back from
        his eyes. Madden.

        The lights ahead were red now. Urquhart swung into the left lane about a hundred yards from 20th. He couldn't say
        where he was going or what he was going to do. It would come to hint, or he to it. Remain in motion. Move
        through the night.

        The lights were red. Urquhart had the clutch in but he hadn't touched the brake. He was going about 25 coming up
        to the stop line. He hesitated a moment, rolling through the crosswalk, slowing slightly on the upgrade as he
        entered the intersection. There was no traffic.
    </div>

    <div title="Take Off">
        <prolepsis>He looked back again, saw Madden still behind him. Ref‌lex reaction. U must f‌lee.

        Urquhart coaxed the gearshift into f‌irst, wound the engine up and popped the clutch. The rear tires spun and then
        took hold, and the car bolted toward the next light, which was still a fresh red. Urquhart shifted up, standing on the
        gas. He was thinking linear thoughts. He denied the possibility of obstruction. No one would get in his way. Shift
        up to third.

        Behind him Madden jerked his car around the pickup, which had pulled over for a left turn. He was trying to think
        clearly about the situation: what to do? He could break off the chase now, which would halve the chances of a crash
        and keep his own ass intact. He could call just call in the locals and wash his hands of this nutcase. On the other
        hand, there was no telling what Urquhart was up to. Right now it was just reckless driving, but what next? Madden
        checked the intersection as carefully as he could and charged through.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Line of Flight">
        <prolepsis>Coming up to 24th now. He saw Madden run the light behind him. Still in the left lane, still accelerating. The
        speedometer said 45, 50. He shifted up to f‌ifth, surging across 24th about a second ahead of a southbound station
        wagon. The other driver made no attempt to stop.

        No obstructions in the line of f‌light.

        Madden slowed to avoid the station wagon, f‌lied again to be sure the street was clear, then ran the second light. He
        felt his adrenaline reserves kick in, thinking, uh oh, Car Chase Syndrome. His mouth went dry.

        26Dth Street ahead. Oh shit, Madden thought. The intersection cut across at a very steep angle, eight o'clock to
        two o'clock, making it almost impossible to see northbound traffic approaching on the left. Again he considered
        breaking of‌f, but then he saw the lights on the cross street go yellow.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Obstructions">
        <prolepsis>26Dth Street. This was where East Main became West Main, proceeding for six or seven blocks without
        interruptions. The speedometer said 75 and Urquhart f‌igured that was fast enough. Madden was still tailing him,
        but without siren or f‌lashers yet, and he seemed to be falling behind. The lights on 26Dth were yellow. Urquhart put
        on a bit more speed.

        West Hills Linen Service's truck 17 was almost a half hour late on its rounds. The driver, Jaime Colon of 1928 Laredo
        Drive, East Tara, had spent 40 minutes earlier that evening in the lounge of the Plaza Del Rio restaurant, watching the
        Desert Storm news on TV. Mr. Colon had two brothers and a sister in the Gulf. He was anxious about them. Now he
        was anxious about his job, too. Mr. Colon had been warned twice about lateness. When he saw the yellow light at
        26Dth, he also put on a little more speed. He had just turned onto 26Dth from Bustamante and was approaching
        from the south at about 35 miles per hour.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Time and Violence">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart saw the truck for perhaps three seconds, long enough to think about impact and pain. Not long enough to
        react. Staring at the yellow light, checking for cops in the rearview, Jaime Colon did not see the onrushing Porsche
        at all.

        What happened was all very fast. Bodies in space. Intersecting trajectories. It played out so quickly that Madden
        almost couldn't say what he saw.

        Time and violence. Inevitable outcomes. The two tracks closing, too close to call.

        The future already exists.

        The Porsche slipped past the truck with technically no room to spare, at least none you could describe without
        resorting to scientif‌ic precision.

        Frustrating, really.

        All that potential energy, all those incipient f‌ireworks, and the only thing set loose was just this one little spark,

    <div title="Winding In">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart raced into the long unbroken curve on West Main, studying the rearview for any sign of Madden. No
        f‌lashers, no headlights, no shadows moving under the streetlamps. He took his foot off the gas, let the car coast
        through the better part of a mile, braking to a stop f‌inally at Chickamauga, the f‌irst cross street. The light was green.

        He put his head out the window and scanned the road. The night was quiet; nothing stirred. Looking in the mirror,
        trying to sort out the tumult in his head. Watching the empty road, knowing somehow it wasn't over, that if he went
        on watching long enough he'd see those Federal headlights pop up over the rise, coming for him.

        He put the car back in gear, hung a sharp right, then another right, then another, moving of‌f the main streets and into
        dark silent drives, shorter and shorter streets, tighter turns and spirals. He drove up a dead-end street and stopped,
        switching of‌f his headlights.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Emily">
        <prolepsis>He felt abstracted, confused. There seemed no purpose in his being here, no engagement between his mind and the
        moment.

        The streets were still and quiet. The cone of light from the nearest streetlamp was undisturbed by any movement.
        The action was all inside. Blue tubelight still f‌licked through the shutters and curtains. The silent orgy continued.
        A half million men and women in the air, on the ground and at sea, at work, at risk, caught up in the game, while we
        sprawled on our couches and lay in our beds waiting to receive the images. Real only under representation.

        While we waited for the bombs to fall, while we wondered if the rockets would f‌ly. Waiting watching.

        Emily.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Wait, Watch">
        He felt disoriented, giddy. There seemed no purpose to his actions, no f‌it between himself and the world he moved
        through.

        There was no one on the streets. Cars sat idle at the curbs. From every window the blue glow spilled into the night.
        An orgy of watching and waiting. Thousands of men in the air, on the ground and the sea, and all that really is
        happening is television.

        They sat in their living rooms, they lay in their bedrooms waiting for the words, the pictures, the news. Waiting for
        the bombs to fall, waiting for the rockets to f‌ly.

        Waiting watching for the message.

    <div title="Elusive">
        A clarity began to take shape in his mind, a sense of purpose. Urquhart understood what he had to do. He put the
        car back in gear, leaxing the lights of‌f, and swung slowly around.

        He saw a faint glow at the end of the street. Headlights approaching from the left — <analepsis>the way he'd come.</analepsis> Madden?

        He was sitting at the top of a dead-end street. Trapped

        Urquhart gunned the car down the short street, shifting up as soon as he could, twisting the wheel hard right. He
        swung around the turn wildly, rear wheels skidding, throwing smoke. The driver behind him hit the brakes, then the
        horn. Urquhart sped a few blocks down the road, downshifted and veered left. He drove as fast as he could, paid
        no attention to the streets, refused to look in the mirror, turned at random.
    </div>

    <div title="Nerves">
        <prolepsis>He tried not to look but after a while he couldn't keep his eyes from drifting up to the mirror. Two or three times he
        thought he saw Madden's big sedan rounding a turn behind him. Once he was sure he saw it coming up a side
        street as he roared past. There were even a few times he thought he glimpsed the big trench-coated form standing
        on the streetcorner, talking into a pay phone, walking out of the Seven Eleven on West 51st. Once the f‌igure waved
        to him.

        Urquhart's nerves began to grow critically tense. He realized he was spending more time looking in the rearview than
        he was watching the road, and even with the streets so deserted he feared he'd eventually run into trouble. He tried
        to drive faster, hoping to reduce the outside world to an unreadable blur. He found he could only get up to about
        f‌ifty if he wanted to stay off the sidewalk on the turns.

        Then all of a sudden he was blasting down Sangre de Cristo toward the west campus and he saw the lights of the
        Just Say No ahead of him, and under those lights, a solution.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="At the No">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart goosed the Porsche onto East Main without even thinking of looking behind him, then jammed on the
        brakes and brought the car to a stop, body swaying with frustrated inertia.

        Harley Morgan was leaning on the front fender of somebody's Jeep, looking concerned. He recognized his car and
        his eyes went wide.

        "Motherfucker!" he yelled, scrambling off the curb.

        Urquhart put his head out the window. "Get in."

        Harley stopped dead, stone poleaxed by the sight of Uqbari the Car-Thieving Prophet.

        "Hurry up," Urquhart. "They can't be far behind me."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Passenger">
        <prolepsis>"Boris?" Harley blinked hard.

        "Get in, get in."

        He considered. Try a soft approach, maybe. "Okay Boris, sure. I'd be happy to join you, let's go f‌ind a party,
        anything you say. But why don't you let me drive?"

        Urquhart revved the engine and made to roll up his window.

        "Okay, for shit's sake." Harley dashed around to the passenger side, hauled the door open and f‌lung himself in.
        "Boris, be cool for Chrissake. I mean, can we talk about this?"

        Urquhart released his left foot convulsively and Harley's skull popped back against the headrest. "Nice car," he
        remarked.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Among Friends">
        <prolepsis>"Boris you twisted fuck. Anything happens to this car, I'll pull your balls off and hang them up like fuzzy dice."

        Urquhart made a screaming full-gee turn onto 15th, straying into the oncoming lane and narrowly missing another
        car.

        "Aiyee." Harley began to feel sick.

        Urquhart peered into his side mirror. "Straighten up, Harley. I need your help."

        Harley was root‌ing around the footwell looking for something persuasive, beer bottle, f‌ire iron, brick, something like
        that.

        "That car we just passed, was it a big dark blue sedan? Like something out of Hawaii Five-O?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Moving Violation">
        <prolepsis>Harley was thinking about just going ahead and strangling the sonofabitch when he noticed a f‌licker of light
        ref‌lecf‌ing off the dashboard. Red, white, blue. Kind of patriot‌ic.

        Harley took a look over his shoulder and his eyes went wide. "Oh perfect."

        "It's that sedan isn't it?" Urquhart said. "I don't want to look"

        Harley threw a hard right against Urquhart's forearm. Which wasn't such a good idea, since it caused the car to
        lunge hard to the left, scrabbling and skidding along the shoulder.

        "No, you crazy shithead, it's not any damned sedan. It's a fucking police cruiser, and I think you better pull over
        right now."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Car Chase">
        <prolepsis>Harley checked on the pursuit. There were now two cruisers behind them, lights f‌lashing sirens blaring. He tried to
        remember if the rules of engagement in Tara allowed shoot‌ing out the tires. Though that might not be necessary: the
        cops behind them were enthusiastic and good at their work, Urquhart was pushing seventy but the cruisers were
        gaining.

        "Boris, what in God's name are you trying to prove? Stop the car before you get us killed."

        He shook his head. "Sorry."

        One of the police cars was now within f‌if‌iy feet of their taillights. "PULL OVER NOW."

        "Oh fuck." There were lights ahead of them now, too.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Sorry...">
        <prolepsis>The lights up ahead proved to belong as Harley truly hoped they wouldn't, to two more patrol cars hastily pulled
        hood-to-hood across the road. Urquhart shifted down into fourth for better acceleration. He showed no indicat‌ion
        of stopping.

        Well shit, Harley thought, phone Fitzmaurice and tell him he was right. Guess I shoula have gone to Bahrain. The
        barricade was about two miles up the road now. Urquhart was pushing the car over eighty, gripping the wheel with
        knotted f‌ists.

        Facing relatively certain death, Harley found himself momentarily capable of detachment. "Okay, f‌ine, so we're going
        to be killed," he conceded. "Would you mind telling me why?"

        Urquhart glanced over apologet‌ically. "Sorry. There isn't time to explain."

        "Fuck you." So much for detachment. "Fuck you, f‌uck you, fuck you!"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Regrets">
        <prolepsis>They'll have shotguns up there, Harley ref‌lected, and they just might shoot out the windows when we get in range.
        He thought of crawling into the back seat but he'd covered enough highway disasters to know that backseat
        passengers usually died horribly in the f‌ire. Oh well.

        It occurred to him that there were two things he deeply regretted. First, that he'd never make love with Veronica
        again, and second, that he wouldn't get to beat the living crap out of Urquhart for it.

        It was at this point that something entirely plausible happened

        Let me explain.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Our American Way of Life">
        Folks, <analepsis>the President's already told you that we didn't go to war in the Gulf to protect no fragile shoots of democracy
        in Kuwait.</analepsis> And gee, it looks like we weren't really f‌ighting to save the world from the f‌iendish Saddam Hussein,
        because at this writ‌ing he's st‌ill over there in Baghdad trying to cut the deal on a sequel. Of course, some of those
        nattering nabobs etc. they'll tell you the whole thing was a sham, one big geopolit‌ical smokescreen meant to make
        the beginnings of a major crash look like just a mild recession.

        Have none of it, my friend.

        We all know <analepsis>there was only one reason we jumped in to save the House of Saud's royal Arabian ass.</analepsis> I know what it
        was. You know what it was. <prolepsis>Harley and Urquhart are about to f‌ind out, when we get back to them in another
        sentence or two, just what that shining compelling reason was.</prolepsis> Okay, next screen.
    </div>

    <div title="Gas?">
        They were f‌lying along toward increasingly certain doom and mut‌ilation, 85 miles an hour straight down the maw of
        death, when all of a sudden the engine choked and shuddered.

        "Eh?" said Urquhart.

        "Oh yes, THANK you Jesus!" Harley shouted, momentarily overcome with spirituality.

        The fuel gauge read bone-empty. <analepsis>It had in fact been headed south of "E" for the last half hour, but nobody had
        noticed.</analepsis>

        Jesus and German engineering having done their share, Harley was only too glad to f‌inish saving their necks. He
        mashed his left foot down on the brake pedal and yanked the hand lever for good measure. The Porsche skidded
        madly, spun nose-for-tail, and fetched up at last about a yard and a half from the police barricade.
    </div>

    <div title="Safe At Last">
        <prolepsis>They were turned more or less broadside across the road. Harley looked out his window and saw the two chase cars
        brake in smartly, swinging around to close the box. Spotlights swivelled in on them, one of them catching Harley
        right in the eyes. He started to put his hand up against the glare but remembered what he'd learned about soldiers,
        guerillas, terrorists, and other excitable boys. No sudden movements. One of the searchlights glinted off the
        rearview mirror and Harley heard somebody ratchet his shotgun.

        "For God's sake sit st‌ill," he told Urquhart. "Don't even fart."

        All it will take, he realized, is for one of them to see what he thinks is a gun barrel or a muzzle f‌lash, and when they
        get f‌inished we'll look like Bonnie and Clyde. Shit, they'll say we were Bonnie and Clyde. Or Willie Horton and... he
        glanced at Urquhart's costume. Oh perfect.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not So Safe">
        <prolepsis>OPEN THE DOORS VERY SLOWLY AND GET OUT OF THE CAR. KEEP YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEADS.

        Urquhart's head was reeling again. What was he doing here at rest? He needed to be in motion. The lights were
        glaring, blinding him.

        Harley eased his car door open using extreme care. "Come on, Boris old buddy. Everything's gonna be f‌ine. Let's
        just do it like they say."

        Urquhart couldn't understand what was happening. He couldn't see what was going on. There was too much light.
        He was able to make out only a small patch of their surroundings. Everything else was f‌looded in glare.

        YOU IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. ROLL DOWN YOUR WINDOW AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE DOOR.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Urquhart's Answer">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart decided he would look into the patch of darkness. It was easier than looking into the harsh light. So he
        looked into the unilluminated night and he was amazed at what he saw there.

        "Boris fella," Harley said from outside the car, "I really think you should be doing what they want. Are you
        listening?"

        REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE. PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD AND DO NOT MOVE.

        Off to Urquhart's right the wedge of darkness framed a bit of meadow and a limestone hummock. At the top of this
        little rise was a familiar building, whitewashed with streaks of rust. Classic in its design, a slotted dome. The old
        observatory. The answer to everything.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Collar">
        The police advanced in waves, all of them armed, ready to shoot, and extremely alert. Harley kept his hands glued to
        his head. He knew the cops would relax a little once they'd made body contact, and he knew to keep his mouth shut
        until that happened. His play was then to point out, as calmly as possible, that this was all a horrible accident, an
        episode of sheer insanity.

        Urquhart was still staring f‌ixedly off to his right, fascinated by something Harley couldn't see. Harley f‌igured he was
        in some kind of shock or psychot‌ic withdrawal, or both. Neither of these were terms he could easily def‌ine.

        But then, Harley was about to learn a great deal more about both shock and psychosis.

        Presently the two point men opened Urquhart's door and hustled him out, using a none-too-subtle headlock. Harley
        started to protest but shut himself up.
    </div>

    <div title="A Good Thing">
        <prolepsis>Harley felt big hands on his shoulders. They'll probably cuf‌f me, he thought, but then he thought he heard
        somebody out at the edge of the lights say, "No no, don't cuff 'em yet. Remember?"

        He got this cold feeling in the pit of his stomach.

        Harley opened his mouth to speak but all that came out was his wind, helped along by a f‌ist driven into his ribcage.
        He fell to the ground and covered up. Someone kicked him very nearly in the balls.

        "Easy there, Todd. Gotta make a good thing last."

        Oh Fitzmaurice, he thought, why don't I ever listen?</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Positive ID">
        <prolepsis>Two sweaty men in helmets and leather jackets grabbed Urquhart and threw him against the side of the Porsche. He
        dropped down on his ass.

        "Lookit this," one of them said, "it's Sodomy Shame himself."

        "I don't believe it. Forget the cuf‌fs, Charley, go get some o' that yellow ribbon." Urquhart tried to get his feet under
        him but the f‌irst cop hooked his st‌ick behind his heels, knocking him down again.

        "Sarge, look. This guy's dressed up for Hallowe'en. Maybe he was on his way to a protest march or something."

        "What've we got in the car?"

        "Keep your shirt on, I'm looking. Oh hey. Bingo." Automat‌ic pistol, 9 mm.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Wallet">
        <prolepsis>"Okay," the voice outside the lights said. "Put the white boy in the car and bring his nigger friend over here."

        Wake up, thought Harley, you're having another bad one. I didn't hear that. This is 1991. His diaphragm was
        struggling to f‌ill his def‌lated lungs. He was full of adrenaline, suddenly full of clarity. One of the cops who'd hit him
        bent down to get him on his feet and Harley managed a few words in his ear.

        "My wallet, dickhead." The cop wrenched Harley's arms behind his back and slapped on a pair of handcuf‌fs. He
        reached into Harley's bomber jacket and drew out his billfold.

        "What's he say?" the second cop wanted to know

        "Oh shit," the f‌irst one told him.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Press">
        <prolepsis>"What's the matter, Todd?" the distant voice called over.

        The cop who'd taken Harley's wallet turned his head. "Jesus, Sarge, this one's working press."

        A silence ensued. Harley sank to his knees, sick to his stomach.

        "Local paper, radio?" the sergeant asked. "He don't look familiar."

        "Oh shit no," Harley's second assailant chimed in, turning Harley's press card to the light. "He's fucking CNN!"

        "Bullshit."

        "No, look."

        "Oh Christ."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not Funny">
        <prolepsis>"Well I dunno," the sergeant said. "How many cars we got here, four? And did anybody call for backup?"

        There was a general round of denials, followed by another long silence. Harley heard intermittent bursts of police
        traffic over the car speakers. One of their dispatchers had patched the audio feed from — of all things, CNN — into
        his channel. He heard Bernie Shaw in Baghdad trying to make a joke about surgical bombing. Like all of Bernie's
        jokes it sounded like even he didn't think it was funny.

        Oh Bernie, Harley thought, have I got a joke for you.

        "Well get him in the fucking car and we'll f‌igure it out on the way to County General."

        That's right, Harley thought, get me to a fucking hospital. Then he realized what was probably going to happen en
        route.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Slippery">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart was bent over against the trunk of a patrol car listening to one of the arresting officers pulling out his
        handcuf‌fs. The cops seemed tense all of a sudden, apprehensive. They were shoving Harley toward another car.
        He was kicking and swearing and dodging.

        Urquhart turned his head to the left. There was the observatory, no more than two or three hundred yards across an
        open f‌ield. He only needed to get f‌ree. He heard a car approaching from the east, travelling pretty fast from the
        sound of it.

        "Get him in the car and let's get the hell out of here," someone told the cop behind Urquhart. He felt the cuffs land
        on his wrist but before the cop could snap them shut he bucked back f‌iercely, knocking the back of his skull against
        his captor's forehead. Urquhart turned and made for the side of the road.

        Someone said, "Oh Jesus what now?" Several shots were f‌ired.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Federal">
        <prolepsis>Running for the ditch, Urquhart caught a glimpse of the car that had just skidded up to the barricade. He saw the
        man who leaped from the car, reaching inst‌incf‌ively toward his armpit at the sound of gunf‌ire. Madden.

        Urquhart threw himself over the guardrail into the ditch, scrambling to his feet and making for the hillside. Two of
        the cops ran to the side of the road and tried to get a bead on him, but it was too dark. Somebody swung a
        searchlight in his direction.

        "Hey Madden, over here!" Harley was yelling, st‌ill f‌ight‌ing to stay out of the police car.

        Madden turned, wide-eyed, saw one of the local constabulary drive his nightst‌ick into Harley Morgan's gut. Which
        was about all he needed to see.

        "FBI! FBI!" Madden shouted, "what the fuck's going on here?"</prolepsis>

    <div title="l'Etat de Tate">

    </div>

    <div title="Ring">
        U ran through the dark f‌ield, slipping and scrambling on the dry ground. He knew Madden was behind him
        somewhere. He did not look.

        U crossed the parking lot and stumbled to the door of the observatory. His ribs were bruised and his mouth was
        bloody; his clothes were torn and in disarray. None of this mattered, since U had almost no awareness of his
        physical state. He was aware only of the idea that had seized him, the necessity.

        The answer to everything.

        The double doors were locked but there was, unaccountably, a pushbutton. U pressed and waited. There was
        music playing inside. Something strange, alien: Wagnerian overtures arranged for koto. Through the frosted glass
        of the door he could see a light approaching moving up and down in phase with its bearer's gait. Tate opened the
        door, shining his light in his visitor's eyes.
    </div>

    <div title="Fool's Errand">
        <prolepsis>Tate examined what his light revealed: Uqbari the Prophet come calling. When, he wondered idly, did the poor boy
        start working door-to-door? Tate shook his head. Tonight, he ref‌lected, was a night of strange appearances — out
        there by the Lagrangian points, over in the Arabian sky, and now right here on his doorstep. A night of strange
        changes.

        "Boris," Tate said by way of greet‌ing.

        U said nothing just stood there immobile, staring. Presently Tate not‌iced the rents in his clothing the blood on his
        face.

        "For heaven's sake, what fool's errand have you been on?" He pushed the door open and ushered U into the
        entryway. They passed into the dome.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Dome">
        <prolepsis>Using his provostial inf‌luence, Tate had claimed the old observatory as his informal study. The inside of the dome
        had become a curious place, part working observatory, part private library. On this level the circular f‌loor was more
        of a platform, only a few yards wide, surrounding a deep well sunk into the foundat‌ions to accommodate the
        machinery of the telescope mount. U glanced at the instrument angling up to the huge slotted opening in the
        ceiling. The topmost panels were rolled back.

        "I made some interest‌ing observaf‌ions earlier," Tate explained "It's been a momentous evening."

        U walked over to the edge of the platform. An iron railing and a plain wooden workbench surrounded the well. All
        around the cavernous room, nearly every inch of space on the bench was occupied: books, papers, charts, cases,
        computers, gadgets, general litter.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Memorobilia">
        <prolepsis>"It's not very tidy around here," Tate allowed. "But when an old scholar gets to a certain age, he stops worrying
        about keeping things in order."

        U walked idly around the room, lifting book covers and glancing at spines. He came across t‌itles in astronomy,
        economics, military science, systems theory. There were also loose papers, printouts, totem objects and knicknacks.
        At one point U found an old framed photograph propped against the railing. It looked like a portrait of a stickup
        gang from the 1930's. The men wore pinstripe suits and leather jackets and stared at the camera with a sort of vague
        canine menace. The central f‌igure was a husky young man with pomaded hair. His right arm was set in an enormous
        cast, braced with wire at an odd angle. It looked like he'd been in some kind of shootout.

        "Memento," Tate said, seeing him with the picture. "Some very interest‌ing gents I met in the fort‌ies. Do you know
        them?" U put the picture back on the counter. The faces didn't register.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Help Mister Wizard">
        <prolepsis>"So," Tate said, leaning against the edge of the cluttered workbench. "Do you want to tell me about this latest

        Running his hand over a stack of books, coming to rest against a fat volume, Jane's All the World's Ordnance,
        1989-90. He stared back at Tate, unblinking.

        "Say, Boris, don't you think it's t‌ime you had some help?" Tate queried.

        "I came for an answer," U said.

        Tate laughed. "Well sorry, son, looks like you came to the wrong place altogether."

        U picked up the book. It was quite heavy. Ponderous.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Ring Cycle">
        Once more U ran through the dark f‌ield, slipping and scrambling on the dry ground. He knew Madden was behind

        U crossed the parking lot and stumbled to the door of the observatory. His ribs were st‌ill bruised and his mouth was

        The answer to everything. Now more than ever.

        The double doors were locked but there was a pushbutton. U pressed and waited. Strange music came from inside:
        Billy Van Saxgutter singing songs of the Argentine pampas. Through the frosted glass of the doors he could see a
        light approaching moving up and down in phase with its bearer's gait. Tate opened the door, shining his light in his
        visitor's eyes.
    </div>

    <div title="Errant Fool">
        <prolepsis>Tate examined what his light revealed: Uqbari the Pissing Prophet. When, he wondered idly, did the prophet start

        between the earth and the moon, over in the sky above Baghdad, and now right here on his doorstep. A night of
        improbable outcomes.

        "Boris," Tate said by way of greeting.

        U said nothing, just stood rooted in place, staring. Presently Tate not‌iced the rips in his coveralls, the welts and
        bruises coming out on his face.

        "For heaven's sake, what kind of lunacy have you been up to?" He pushed the door open and let him come inside.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Retreat">
        <prolepsis>Using his provost‌ial inf‌luence, Tate had claimed the old observatory as his personal keep. The inside of the dome
        was now a strange hybrid, part working observatory, part private library. On this level the f‌loor was just a few yards
        wide, encircling a deep well sunk into the foundations to accommodate the mechanism of the telescope mount. U
        looked at the big cylinder pointed up at the huge slotted opening in the ceiling. The topmost weather panels were
        still rolled back.

        "I've been watching some interesting things happen," Tate explained "It's been an excit‌ing evening."

        U walked over to the edge of the platform. An iron railing and a plain wooden workbench ran around the well. All
        through the cavernous room, nearly every inch of space on the bench was taken up by books, papers, charts, cases,
        computers, gadgets, general litter.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Group Shot">
        <prolepsis>"It's kind of a mess around here," Tate allowed. "Frankly, I don't want to be bothered with straightening up."

        U walked idly around the room, lifting book covers and glancing at spines. He came across t‌itles in astrophysics,
        economics, military science, cognit‌ive psychology. There were also loose papers, printouts, trophies, fet‌ishes, and
        knicknacks. At one point U found an old framed photograph propped against the railing. It looked like a gangster
        portrait from the 1930's. A few small-time hoods posed with the local Mister Big. The men wore padded suits and
        fedoras and stared at the camera as if violence could not be ruled out. U expected to see tommy guns. The central
        f‌igure was a beefy young guy with slicked-back hair. His right arm was somewhat the worse for wear, done up in a
        huge cast.

        "Memento," Tate said, seeing him with the picture. "Men I knew in the fort‌ies. Do you recognize them?" U put the

        "Boris, don't you think it's t‌ime you talked to someone?" Tate pressed him.

        "I came here for an answer," U said.

        Tate laughed. "Wish I could be more encouraging Boris. But I'm short on answers, myself."

        U picked up the book. It was very heavy. Voluminous.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Ring Around">
        U is once again st‌ill always running through that dark f‌ield, slipping scrambling through his own footprints on the

        you know.

        U crosses the parking lot stumbles against the door of the observatory. His ribs hut like hell and his mouth is full of
        clotted blood; his clothes are still a mess. This doesn't matter, since U has pract‌ically no awareness of his physical
        state. He is aware only of the idea that has seized him, the necessity, the overwhelming need.

        The answer to everything. Everything for nothing now.

        The double doors are locked but there's a pushbutton, which he presses. Strange music comes from inside: sounds
        like Laurie Anderson scatt‌ing the third movement of Rimski-Korsakov's Scheherezade. A light is coming toward him,
        swinging up and down with its bearer's step. Tate opens the door, shining his light in his visitor's eyes.
    </div>

    <div title="Arrant Fool">
        <prolepsis>Tate took a look at what his light revealed: Uqbari the Prophet of the Pool. What, he wondered idly, brought the
        prophet to his neighborhood? Tate shook his head. Tonight, he ref‌lected, was full of weirdness — out there in the
        heavens, up in the skies above Baghdad, and now right here on the doorstep. A night of unlikely developments.

        "Boris," Tate greeted him.

        U said nothing, just stood staring. Tate stared back, noticing the gashes in his coveralls, the purple bruises

        "For heaven's sake, what sort of mess have you been in?" He shoved the door open and let him in.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Temple">
        <prolepsis>Using his provostial inf‌luence, Tate had turned the old observatory into his unoff‌icial workshop. The inside of the
        dome was now a strange combination of working observatory and private reading room. On this level the f‌loor was
        just a few yards wide, surrounding a deep well sunk into the foundations to make room for the telescope mount. U
        looked at the giant cylinder pointing up through the ceiling. It had been in use recently: some of the weather panels
        were still rolled back.

        "It's been interesting viewing tonight," Tate explained. "Rare things indeed."

        U walked over to the edge of the platform. An iron railing and a plain wooden workbench ran around the well. All

        <prolepsis>"It's sheer chaos around here," Tate allowed. "Frankly, I work better under these conditions."

        U walked idly around the room, riffling pages and glancing at spines. He came across titles in astronautics,
        economics, military science, cybernetics. There were also loose papers, phonograph records, printouts, the
        occasional thing in a jar. At one point U found an old f‌lamed photograph propped against the railing. It looked
        like a group shot of some depression-era gunsels. Hijackers, numbers runners, pimps, that sort. The men wore
        suits with broad lapels and stared at the camera with a sort of absentminded nastiness. U expected shoes with
        spats. The central f‌igure was a round-faced fellow with his hair parted down the middle. His right arm was wired
        into a big sloppy cast, looking like it was stuck halfway in a Fascist salute.

        "Memento," Tate said, seeing him with the picture. "Old f‌riends from the war. Know any of them?" U put the

        Running his hand over a stack of books, coming to rest against a hefty volume, Jane's All the World's Killing
        Machines, 1989—90. He stared back at Tate, unblinking.

        "Boris, you know, it's time you thought about professional help," Tate told him.

        "I came here because I want an answer," U said.

        Tate laughed shortly. "Sorry, Boris, you came to the wrong place. My specialty is questions, actually."

        U picked up the book. It was very heavy. Massive.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Responsive">
        "I came to kill you," U told him.

        Tate considered this. "How interesting, Boris. And why would you want to do that?"

        U looked at him with unwavering eyes. "I don't think you'd understand."

        "Daresay I wouldn't."

        U looked down at the book in his hands. "My mind isn't right. It's all too confusing, unreal. I feel lost."

        Tate took a step toward him, caught a sharp glance of warning; so he held his ground. "You need to rest," he
        suggested.

        U held the book in front of him. "I need an answer to the night," U insisted.
    </div>

    <div title="Answered">
        <prolepsis>"Boris," Tate said as gently as he could, "I really don't know what you're talking about."

        "You have the answer," U replied. "Tate. The answer to everything."

        Tate walked over to him put his hands on the poor fellow's shoulders, tried to calm him down. "Hey, now, Boris.
        I'm afraid that makes no sense at all."

        U looked him in the eye, face to face. A spark of recognition settled on him a moment of recovery.

        "No," he said. "It doesn't make sense."

        Urquhart let go of the book. It fell heavily onto the toes of Tate's left foot.

        "Ow."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Relic">
        Tate shrugged and pushed himself off the railing. "Well as long as you've dropped by, I've got something here I'd
        like to show you. Something you might f‌ind interesting."

        Tate turned to an old metal cabinet and reached to a high shelf, taking down an old leather portfolio, stitched up
        with thick black ribbon and stuffed untidily with papers, yellowed and creased with age. "This came into my hands
        years ago," Tate explained, "but I've only just realized its importance."

        He cleared a space on the workbench and set the portfolio in front of them. "I've been studying Japanese over the
        last few years, and I've f‌inally become good enough with the script to decipher this." He opened the leather folio
        carefully, revealing a large page of rice paper written over in graceful, trailing brush strokes.

        "This is the prison journal of Ishibashi Taro, better known to the world of letters as Master Johdan."
    </div>

    <div title="Very Sad">
        <prolepsis>"Who?" U wondered.

        "Such ignorance," Tate scolded him. "Master Johdan was one of the greatest Japanese intellectuals of the wartime

        "Never heard of him."

        Tate shook his head. "Such a shame. He died young and at the wrong time, and his work's been badly neglected
        It was November, 1945. Johdan was awaiting trial for war crimes, though there's little doubt he would have been
        cleared and rehabilitated. But such bad luck. A week before the trial he suffered a fatal seizure, most likely a
        stroke. He was only 43. Very sad."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Last Words">
        <prolepsis>"A stroke," U repeated.

        Tate snapped his f‌ingers. "Like that, really."

        "Unfortunate," U said.

        "Oh yes," Tate assured him. "The world lost a very rare mind that morning, a real visionary." He laid his hand on
        the old paper. It was mottled with moisture and spills but its bright inclusions still caught the light. Brilliant.

        "What you see there are the last words he wrote," Tate informed him. "If you'll pardon my somewhat halting
        translation, I'll read it to you," Tate of‌fered.

        U said nothing, so he began.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Postindustrial">
        <prolepsis>"Fifth of November. Light dissolves in the sky like the cry of a fishmonger who has come to the wrong street. The
        man was very lyrical. Let's see, this next part is mainly about his bowels, then there's this about his mother... Oh
        but here it is: In regard to the subject of economic redevelopment. It is to be remembered, even in the face of the
        total devastation we now experience, that the rebuilding of factories and shipyards represents only the f‌irst
        stage in the coming of a new world order. If our nation would prosper in the coming decades we must expand
        our horizons. We must consider our destiny in ways that transcend material production "

        "Well," U noted, "this all has a familiar ring to it."

        "Wait, the best is yet to come."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Shadows">
        <prolepsis>"The war and its great upheavals have made certain things plain to those who will see. The nature of our
        societies will be transformed. Productive capacity cannot be relied upon as the source of economic strength.
        Certainly we must anticipate a divergence of the industrial and the service sectors, with the latter no longer
        viewed as simply an auxiliary to industry. But let us not be — sorry, there's a curious idiom here, it literally means
        'having a narrow anus' — in our predictions. Let us anticipate a point where the bulk of all economic activity is
        so far removed from any traffic in actual commodities that it may be called an economy of shadows — or maybe I
        should say 'appearances.'"

        "Shadows." U still unimpressed.

        "Pay attention, Boris. I think you'll f‌ind the next part most interesting."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Hold That Thought">
        <prolepsis>"Contrary to what politicians say," Tate read, "the great struggle of the next fifty years does not pit the
        communists against the capitalists, or the industrialists against the speculators. The contenders in this conflict
        will be those who work in earth and those who work in shadows. I believe that the workers in shadows will
        necessarily gain their victory. I believe we must prepare for the great game of shadows."

        "Well," U remarked, "he'd been reading his Hermann Hesse."

        Tate pointed to the foot of the page, where a column of characters ended abruptly. There was a faint feathery trace
        where the brush had rolled away.

        "That," Tate indicated, "was very likely the thought that killed him."

        U considered. "If thoughts could kill."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Virtu">
        <prolepsis>Tate folded Master Johdan's papers reverently and laid them aside. "Sad to die so young," he ref‌lected, "but you
        might as well go out as a prophet, eh?"

        U blinked, as if remembering something.

        "So, Boris," Tate went on, laying an appropriating hand on the younger man's rumpled collar. "Speaking of
        prophecies, what would you say to this..."

        <fid>What is the answer to the night?</fid>

        "I've been talking to friends of mine in government and industry," Tate went on. "The National Research Council,
        the Council of Economic Advisers, the Trilaterals. I've proposed that we begin feasibility studies of a virtual
        economy."

        Urquhart looked at him blankly.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="We Can Work It Out">
        <prolepsis>"I'm talking about a systematic application of Master Johdan's vision. Think about it, Boris. A vast simulation
        embracing all aspects of economic activity, a gigantic competitive structure with hundreds of millions of players —
        or are they workers? — who would in fact derive their livelihood from subsidies paid out according to their
        performance in the game. A game involving technologies, politics, laws, regulations, ideas, trends, fashions,
        philosophies, belief systems. I'm talking about greatest imaginative endeavor in human history."

        U stroked his hand slowly over Master Johdan's withered page. "Where have I heard this before?"

        Tate made a dismissive face. "It was all speculation then. But Boris, with these new technologies of yours, with
        virtual realities and cybemetic spaces and my Lord, now even interactive dreams, we can make this vision a reality.
        We can create a system, Boris. We can make it work"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Forget...">
        U realized that he was still holding the book in his lef‌t hand He held it before him, studying the cover. A
        Comprehensive Review of Weapons and Delivery Systems.

        If thoughts could kill.

        Tate saw what he was looking at. "Forget that, Boris. Put it aside. Forget all this obsession with the war. Take
        some time to rest, to put your head in order. You could even stay here if you like — there's a little apartment down
        below that no one's used for years. Then when you feel stronger, you can get back to work Achieve. something."

        U held the heavy book, thinking.

        The answer...

    <div title="Mad">
        The door f‌lew open behind them and U turned, startled.

        "Come over here," Tate was saying, "I have something you need to see."

        But U stood rooted to the spot, unable to take his eyes from the door. A f‌igure stepped into the framed black
        rectangle of the night, stepped through the door and out of the shadows...

        And U felt the swarming come down on him, the dislocation the displacement the broadcast breakdown there you
        go again confusing the apparent with the invisible with the here and now rushing together entwining madly with
        the where and when...

        Swarming... but a f‌igure was walking through the doorway and that f‌igure was solid and distinct, strong as a

        Madden.

    <div title="Faceoff">
        <prolepsis>U jumps back into f‌light, dashes for the farthest corner of the room, ho ho, neat trick in a circular chamber where
        the faster you run the sooner you end up where you started. Madden is in the room now f‌ixing U with his heavy
        gaze and standing there hands in his coat pockets, casual, just real casual now. Relax, everybody.

        "Say, Boris. Can we talk?"

        The two men are faced off diametrically across the well, twelve to six. U feints a step to his left. Madden gets a
        little jumpy, lunges an inch or so out of pure ref‌lex, but come on, this is a seasoned professional we're dealing with.
        He sees what's up, makes a fast break to his own lef‌t as U starts to run right. They stop short, staring. Standoff.

        "Was there a point to all this?"

        He had to think about it.</prolepsis>

    <div title="So Started">
        <prolepsis>U considered. "A statement?" he ventured.

        Madden reached his right hand into his coat. Holy shit, U said to himself and hit the deck hard. Madden came out
        with his ballpoint and Papermate. Click. "Statement, yeah?"

        U blinked back at him from behind the cover of an old PC.

        "Go ahead," said Madden. "You should pardon the expression, but shoot."

        "Peace now," U told him. "Liberty and justice for all."

        Madden stowed the pen and paper, shrugging. "It's kind of a tall order, but we'll do our best." He turned and
        walked to the door.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Homefront">
        Amanda Fairbairn was standing there obviously antsy, shifting from foot to foot like a sprinter, f‌ingers at the zipper
        of her midnight blue jump suit. Inching it midway down her sternum as they peered around the doorway at the
        security man. "Now?"

        Jude put her f‌ingers to her lips. "Keep your pants on."

        "Aw."

        Jude grabbed her young accomplice by the shoulders and pulled her back into the stairwell. "Jeez," she whispered.
        "you're really hot to do it, aren't you?"

        Amanda nodded with a sort of crazed enthusiasm. "What a rush."

        Jude rolled her eyes.
    </div>

    <div title="You're No Fun">
        <prolepsis>"This isn't about getting a rush," Jude reminded her as soberly as she could. "It's about information."

        "What good is information if there's no fun in it?"

        Jude clapped her hand over her co-conspirator's mouth. Footsteps, slow and measured, coming their way. She
        eased the stairway door closed and folded herself into the shadows. A second or two later the watchman's hand
        tried the knob and found it secure. She heard the footsteps again, receding.

        "This should be all kinds of fun," Jude murmured. "Assuming we f‌ind what I'm looking for up there." She pushed
        her key back into the doorknob, turned the tumblers silently, eased the door open a crack, reconnoitering.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Strategy">
        <prolepsis>Amanda got ready with that zipper again and Jude was thinking, Oh shit just my style, taking an underage
        exhibitionist along on a high-security breakin. But still, if you happened to need a handy diversion...

        The plan was simple enough. Victor's key to the utility tunnel got them into the Tower; the next sticking point was
        the twenty-four-hour guard on the security desk in the lobby. A little streaking episode, they f‌igured, ought to
        distract the desk man long enough for Jude to slip over to the Presidential elevator.

        Jude had her reservations, though. Mainly she didn't like the risk to Amanda if she was caught. Also she could use
        a lookout and maybe an extra hand for the upstairs phase of the operation. She pulled back her kaff‌iyeh and put her
        ear to the door. What she heard lef‌t her with confused feelings. Dismay, anger, shock — but for the moment, a kind
        of relief.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Flirt">
        <prolepsis>...received reports of at least six Scud f‌irings, with at least one rocket landing somewhere in the city of Riyadh,
        Saudi Arabia...

        The volume was up high and Jude could see that the guard's attention was entirely set on the little screen. She took
        hold of Amanda's slippery zipper and tugged it up around her throat. "No baretailing it tonight. Come on, I'm going
        to need your help."

        They slithered out the doorway, keeping to the shadows, stepping precisely on silent soles. They passed right
        behind the guard, within inches of his chairback, in easy reach of his holstered .38. Amanda, true child of chaos,
        made a tentative reach for the shiny handgrip but Jude seized her wrist. When they got safely around the corner
        from the guard she got hold of Amanda's plump little ass and gave it a good hard tweak. Amanda said Ouch but the
        cry was covered by the takeof‌f roar of a British Tornado.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Up...">
        <prolepsis>Jude felt along the ornamental panelling found the concealed pushbutton just where Veronica told her it would be,
        waited a long ten seconds while nothing happened. Then the little car arrived and the disguised door pulled back,
        making a racket that seemed impossible to ignore.

        "Fast."

        They slipped into the secret elevator and held their breath as the door rolled across. Jude listened hard for footsteps
        but heard nothing. If they were lucky, that meant the guard had been too caught up in the war show to notice the
        car descending. On the other hand, maybe he had heard. Maybe he'd just picked up his radio and called for backup.
        Or maybe he wasn't suprised to hear the elevator running because it had been running earlier. Maybe President
        Larry was already up there. Now that could be awkward. The car rose slowly. Six, ten, twelve... last stop. "P." For
        Private.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="And In">
        <prolepsis>The car slowed and dipped, the door started its motion. Jude and Amanda tried to squeeze into the corners of the
        doorframe but there wasn't nearly enough cover. The door stopped with a bump.

        There was a light on, a desklamp. Jude held her breath. Bolder Amanda poked her ski-masked head out and peered
        into the small room. No one was visible.

        "All clear," she said conversationally, making Jude wince.

        "Sssh." She pointed a silent f‌inger at each of two oak-paneled doors, either of which might open at any moment.
        Never one to wait for trouble, Amanda just traipsed on over and jerked the doors open. The f‌irst led to an executive
        washroom, unoccupied. The second revealed a f‌light of stairs leading to a higher point on the tower. Amanda was
        intrigued, but Jude dragged her back to the task at hand. "Come on."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="High Road">
        <prolepsis>They made a quick survey of the room, checking out credenzas, coat closets, vertical f‌iles, desk drawers, rolodexes.

        "Remember," Jude instructed, "forget the University stuff. We're interested in what he's got going on the side."

        Amanda found a little PC clone skulking in a dark corner. "You stay on the paper trail," she told Jude. "I'll take the
        high road." Amanda unzipped the hip pocket of her jumpsuit, took out a handful of f‌loppies, selected one that felt
        right and slotted it in.

        "Great," Jude said with the traditional f‌lashlight between her teeth. "Just please remember that we haven't got all
        night up here. No system cracking right?"

        Amanda was already tapping away. "Yes, mom."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Nosing Around">
        <prolepsis>Jude watched her f‌ingers rif‌fle over the f‌ile tabs, peeling back the headings. She had only the vaguest idea what she
        might be looking for. She was relying not on sight and judgement but on a more primitive set of senses — intuition,
        touch, the tools of the huntress. Laugh if you want.

        Title IV Reports. Legislative Liaison. Budgetary Summaries 1985-89. EEOC/AA. Security Reviews. Heidel Report,
        hmm. Interesting but not what she came for.

        Jude switched drawers, still browsing. Nowhere, nothing. So she closed her eyes and stopped looking and it was
        in this way that she made her discovery. Actually she smelled it.

        Cigar smoke. Scotch whisky. She put her face close to the drawer and let her nose take her to the folder she wanted.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="On the Board">
        <prolepsis>Jude opened and read, f‌licking the pages rapidly, not really knowing what she'd f‌ind but knowing this was it. And
        what she found was good, very good.

        It was a f‌ile of business correspondence between the President, Laurence M. Stanley, and the f‌irm of Maddox,
        Harrow, and Stone, who represented a f‌irm called GreensCorp. <analepsis>Mr. Stanley had been invited to join the GreensCorp
        board.</analepsis> Which was where things got interesting.

        GreensCorp was an oddly diversif‌ied set of holdings. Oilf‌ields and drilling services, copper mining interests in
        !!Southeast Asia, a shopping mall in Houston, and a large portfolio of sunbelt real estate, chief‌ly luxury golf-course
        condominiums.

        Including the proposed Whitman's Creek project. Well, well.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Accountable">
        <prolepsis>Jude made a few notes and replaced the f‌iles caref‌ully. No need to steal or even copy anything; this was strictly
        reconnaissance. Once the paper trail was started, it was just a matter of passing the right information to her friends
        on the Happening, who would chase down the details.

        Leisure Suit Larry was about to have an accountability crisis. Not that he'd done anything illegal or even technically
        unethical. Not that <analepsis>accepting $117,000 for attending four board meetings, two of them in Palm Springs,</analepsis> was in any
        way improper. But aiding and abetting those who would fuck with the Creek, well...

        Jude felt as if she were at the top of a very large rollercoaster. A moment of charged stillness, then back down into
        the whirl and terror. They were over the top now and it was time to go. She looked around for Amanda, but Amanda
        wasn't in the room.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Parapet">
        <prolepsis>Jude fought down a spike of panic and cleared her head. The elevator hadn't moved — she would have heard if it
        had. The washroom door was closed, as they'd lef‌t it. But the door leading to the stairs was open. It f‌igured. She'd
        gone exploring.

        Checking the room quickly for any signs they may have lef‌t behind, Jude crossed to the dark doorway and swung
        herself up the stairs. The door at the top was ajar. She went through and found herself on a narrow parapet that ran
        around the summit of the Tara Tower. The legendary Thirteenth Floor.

        Amanda was leaning on the rail looking out over the quiet campus. "If the stories are true, more than a dozen people
        have been killed up here," she said. "Suicides mostly."

        "How cheery. Let's go."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Insanity">
        <prolepsis>But Amanda wasn't in a hurry. It began to dawn on Jude that it wasn't fearlessness or thrill-seeking that made the
        girl so bold, but rather a desire to get caught. Or hurt. This was not a pleasant thing to consider at the moment.

        "Ah, you may still be a juvenile," Jude pointed out, "but I could be looking at a felony."

        Amanda was dismissive. "We'd plead insanity."

        "That f‌igures."

        Staring down at a passing Campus Police car, Amanda passed Jude a folded sheet of paper. "Speaking of insanity."

        "What's this?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Document">
        <prolepsis>Jude got out the f‌lashlight, hunkered down below the wall and scanned the paper.

        Dear Mrs. Stellenbosch,

        Thank you for your letter about the proposed tentative revisions in the Western Civilization curriculum at the
        University. As you know I am always sensitive to the concerns of alumni, especially when they have been such
        strong supporters of our academic and athletic programs.

        I share your reservations about the rejection of western culture and traditional values in the proposed curriculum
        revisions. Thank you f‌or letting me know your concerns. I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Chair of the
        Revised Curriculum Committee has agreed to give up that position to a person whose views are more
        representative of the American mainstream. A formal announcement will be made soon...</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Foiled Again">
        <prolepsis>Jude stared at the document in her hands. It was a single sheet, laser printed, unsigned. At the bottom of the page
        was a date, f‌ile name, and disposition line. The extension on the f‌ilename was ".f‌inal" and the disposition line said it
        had been mailed earlier that day.

        "What the hell is this?" Jude wondered.

        "It's our own little piece of Watergate," Amanda said lightly. "The well known smoking gun. Remember how Ollie
        North got caught in Iran-Contra — those memos he thought he'd deleted from his mail system..."

        "When will they ever learn?"

        "Rhetorical question."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Magistrix Ludi">
        <prolepsis>Jude f‌licked off the f‌lashlight and handed the letter back to Amanda, who stashed it inside her suit. This time she
        kept the zipper tight.

        "It's bullshit in the letter, right? I mean, about Thea Agnew resigning."

        Jude nodded. "Most likely. Veronica says Thea wants to tough it out and make it a real f‌ight if she has to. This
        smells like a power play of some kind. If I had to guess, I'd say that somebody's trying to run a game on her."

        Amanda pushed off from the railing and headed down the stairs. "Oh goody. I really like games."</prolepsis>

        Emily walks into the townhouse and the f‌irst thing she sees standing there in the middle of the living room — in fact

        "What am I doing here?" Victor Gardner wanted to know.

        "He coulda been a contender," jibed one of his colleagues.

        "He coulda been on the MTV," suggested another.

        "He coulda gone for his M.B.A. and be polishing his B.M.W.," said a third.

        "Or he he might have joined the Army," a fourth put in, "and went off to work on his tan."

        Gardner gave the woman a ferocious glare.

        "Sorry."

    <div title="Age Before Bounty">
        <prolepsis>"What is the reason for graduate school?" Gardner asked rhetorically. A general groan went up around the table.

        "Buy that man a Miller," Jude Busch suggested.

        "Make him go away," someone else proposed

        "I'll tell you what it's for," Gardner persisted (you knew he would). "It's a scam set up so that overrated,
        underworked assholes like that —" gesturing with his martini glass across the room at his thesis advisor, Boris T.
        Urquhart — "can justify their lives of pointless dissipation. It's another example of the way Age hopelessly fucks
        over Youth in this country."

        Jude leaned over and punched Gardner semi-affectionately in the chops. "I promise we'll take you seriously some
        day, Victor."

        "Yeah," another colleague chimed in, "like the day you tell them they can keep their grant money, and you don't
        want that associate professorship either, thanks."

        Gardner buried his head in his arms as if to weep. But he remembered to hold up his empty glass in case the waitress

        she wanted to be somewhere else. Veronica let go of his queue and turned away but Victor laid a hand on her
        shoulder.

        "Don't bother making him walk a straight line," Jude Busch of‌fered. "He can only do that when he's twisted."

        "What have you heard from Emily?" Victor asked.

        Dear Victor,

        Thanks for your letters. I'm holding up. I'm managing. This is a strange
        place and a strange time but we're all going to make it thru somehow. I
        hope things back in Tara aren't really as bad as you derscribe. Try not to
        be so angry.

        I wish you could accept the way things are. I don't want to pretend nothing
        happened between us but I meant it when I said there couldn't be anything
        more. I'm with Boris for good or bad and that's the right thing for me. If
        that's cruel, I'm sorry. Its honest.

        Give it some time. Balme it all on me if it helps, but get your head
        together please. I don't like all this pain.

        Your friend,
        Emily

    <div title="Victor's Garden">
        They f‌inished at the same time — not such a rare thing, considering this was one of those nights that made
        "sleeping together" an inaccurate description of what they were up to. <analepsis>After four or was it f‌ive attempts,</analepsis> they were
        bound to get the timing right, if only by accident. And get it right they did, though as Big Finishes go this one was
        kind of strange, Emily's and Victor's cries coming precisely in unison, matched one for one until both crashed to the
        mattress, belly to back limbs like spaghetti, kaput.

        Victor zoned right out. It was understandable, really. <analepsis>They'd stretched the night into morning again</analepsis> and the poor
        man was exhausted — though Emily did wish he hadn't drifted off in the middle of a kiss.

        She felt the steady out and in of his chest against her back and knew he was beyond reach. It made her feel oddly
        alone, even so close to him now. It left her alone with her thoughts and emotions, with her body and its memories.
        At the moment such solitude was dangerous, funneling her into a gulf of depression and fear. She started to cry.
    </div>

    <div title="A Man Sleeping">
        <prolepsis>She assumed he was dead to the world, which shows how little she knew him even then, more than a month into the
        af‌fair.

        In fact Victor was always a light sleeper, one of those people for whom sleep and dreaming are like going to the
        opera — you spend some time watching people in strange costumes doing things you can't understand, you nod off
        for a while, you wake up, step out for a pee and something to eat, then you drift on back to watch the next bit.

        Emily wasn't used to this. Remember <analepsis>she'd lived for two and a half years with Boris Urquhart,</analepsis> a man who
        occasionally volunteered his nights to NASA scientists interested in suspended animation. This is the same
        Urquhart who <analepsis>slept unblinking through a terrorist bomb in London that blew out all the windows in his hotel room.</analepsis>

        As far as she knew, sleeping men were all like that, binary creatures, on or off.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="A Woman Crying">
        <prolepsis>But Victor Gardner wasn't a man of such simple polarities, and it didn't take a bomb to rouse him. As it happened
        that morning the sound of a woman quietly crying did the trick.

        Victor put his arms around her waist and kissed the base of her neck. "What's the matter, babe?"

        "I'm scared," she told him. Now that she was awake she could let the tears come harder. She started to cry in
        earnest, her shoulders shaking.

        "What are you scared of?" he asked, stroking her temple.

        "I'm scared of this," she told him. "I'm scared of us, I'm scared of you. The way you make me feel."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Scary">
        <prolepsis>"Did I hurt you?" he asked, concerned.

        "No." She touched his arm reassuringly. "No. But it scares me the way I am with you, Victor. It scares me half to
        death."

        He stroked her hair, nuzzled her cheek. "I don't understand what you're saying. What do you mean? What's so
        scary?"

        "I can't explain. It's just what I feel. I'm scared"

        "Do you mean the sex? Are you still —"

        She shook her head vigorously. "Yes. No, not exactly. There's something scary about it. And no, it’s not just the
        sex either. There are other things."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="A True Story">
        <prolepsis>"You scared, Runbird?" Sergeant Yvonne asked.

        "Aren't you?"

        "Shit no. Takes more than the lights gone out to make me wet my skivvies." She leaned back against Emily's
        shoulder. "Tell you what I am, though, is bored. This is a major drag if you know what I mean, sittin' all night in the
        goddamn dark. Ain't very entertaining is it."

        Emily agreed it was a drag. "So read us a story, Runbird. See if you can f‌ind that crazy bitch's book your man Boris
        sent over."

        "I can't read in this light."

        "All right so tell us a story then. Tell us a true story."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Strange">
        <prolepsis>"What kind of story do you want?" Emily asked.

        Yvonne considered. "Tell me about your man."

        "Sarge," Emily protested, but Yvonne was insistent. "Tell me about the best t‌ime you ever had it. And don't spare
        none of the details."

        Emily couldn't think of what to say. "Come on, girl," Yvonne prompted.

        "Well okay. I don't know about the best t‌ime, but I'll tell you about the strangest."

        The Sergeant laughed. "Whoa now, that's even better. What was so strange about it — did Boris get rough? Did
        he t‌ie you up, or did you t‌ie him up? Did you whack his behind? Did he want to watch you make it with another
        girl?" She thought further. "Aw now, he didn't want to piss on you, did he?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="True Confessions">
        <prolepsis>"No, it wasn't any of those things," Emily explained. She had another nip of that white lightning. "It wasn't even
        with Boris."

        "Whoa, Miss Emily!"

        "And what was strange about was that it was the only time that I ever, you know..."

        "That you ever what?"

        Emily passed the bottle back. "This is just between us, okay?" Yvonne of‌fered up palm. "Trooper's honor," she
        swore.

        Emily shut her eyes. "It's the one and only time I ever came."

        "Girl."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Apart">
        <prolepsis>"It happened last spring while Boris was over in Europe for a semester. I stayed behind to get work done on my
        thesis. Fifteen weeks. We'd been together for about two years and it was the longest I'd ever been apart from him."

        "The man was a fool not to take you," Yvonne declared.

        Emily shrugged. "I didn't ask to go. But after a couple of months I started to feel lonely and then depressed. I hated
        myself and I hated my work. It bothered me being out of touch with my old friends, so I started hanging out with
        them again. I went to parties and got wasted the way I used to when I was uninvolved. I started waking up on
        people's f‌loors and not remembering how I got there."

        Sergeant Yvonne clucked her tongue. "Sweet Jesus, Runbird, I never f‌igured you for such a wild thing."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Victor">
        <prolepsis>"Then one night in April I went to a birthday party for this guy named Victor. I've known him for years. We used to
        go out for a while, but we were both getting over bad relat‌ionships so it stayed casual."

        "Victor. What's he like?"

        Emily drew her knees up. "Nice enough. Tall and skinny, kind of athletic without being a jock. He has great moves.
        For an ordinary white boy from West Tara, he's a real f‌ine dancer." She stopped and smiled. "And lemme tell you,
        what an ass."

        "Sweet cheeks."

        "The sweetest."

        "Well I'm glad you've got taste."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Dangerous">
        <prolepsis>"The thing about Victor," Emily went on, "he was even more fucked up and cynical than I was. I think that was, you
        know, the spark for it all. Something got us started and we couldn't stop bitching. We complained about not having
        money, about no jobs when we f‌inished, about what assholes our professors were. Though Victor's professor was
        Boris, which didn't make me feel too good. Or I don't know, maybe it did."

        Yvonne shook her head. "You sound like one confused chick."

        "I guess I was. Anyway, we were bitching so hard that after a while nobody would talk to us, so I ended up just
        hanging out with Victor. Then I was dancing with him. Then I was kissing him." She paused. "You know what it's
        like to kiss a guy for the f‌irst time, especially when it's a guy you've known for years and maybe you've always
        wondered what kissing him would be like...?"

        "Yeah," Yvonne replied. "The word for that is dangerous..."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Convenience Store">
        <prolepsis>"I was lonely. I was bored. I hadn't been touched in weeks and it was so sweet to feel my arms around him, to feel
        my tongue inside his mouth. I started trembling and I didn't want to stop. So I didn't stop. Around one in the
        morning he said he was heading home and I asked him to take me with him."

        "I guess you knew what you wanted," Yvonne observed.

        "Yeah, well. Maybe I did. Really I couldn't make up my mind. I remember there was this real awkward moment on
        the way to his house. We had to stop at the Circle-K to buy condoms. I told him I'd go in but he thought I'd be
        embarrassed. So I sat there in the car watching him and it felt so strange, you know, like you're scheduled to have
        sex or something. Weird. Made me feel kind of numb, like maybe I didn't want it so much after all."

        "Uh huh. But you couldn't be sure."

        "I guess not."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Bad Timing">
        <prolepsis>"We got to his house and sat on the couch for a while, talking. Then I started kissing him again but it felt wrong this
        time, too cold and technical."

        "Anybody ever tell you that you fuss too much?" the other woman put in.

        Emily made a face. "Constantly."

        "Sorry. So what then?"

        "So then we were in bed. But that was strange, too. Bad timing. First we had to go through all that stuff with the
        damned rubber, which mainly made us laugh. Then for a while it seemed like I couldn't get started, and when I was
        more or less ready, he wasn't."

        "I know that one."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Something Easy">
        <prolepsis>"I think it was around three in the morning we gave up and just lay there with our arms around each other. I fell
        asleep for a little bit and when I woke up I think it was because Victor was snoring."

        "Don't you just hate when that happens."

        Emily bit her lip and laughed. "But just laying there felt so good. There was something easy about him, even
        something familiar, though I remember looking at his face in the moonlight and being surprised that it wasn't Boris."

        "Girl, girl."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Obviously">
        <prolepsis>"Anyway, about four o'clock Victor got up to move to the couch. He tried not to wake me but I wasn't really asleep.
        At f‌irst I didn't understand why he was leaving. Then he crossed into the light and suddenly it was obvious."

        "Like about this obvious?"

        "Like even more than that." Yvonne raised an eyebrow.

        "So at that point I told myself, this is ridiculous, you went home with this guy so that you could make love, he
        obviously wants to, what the hell's wrong with you?"

        Yvonne nodded agreement. "Now you talking sense."

        "So I got up and kissed him and asked him to make love with me."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not Quite">
        <prolepsis>"Okay," Yvonne said, "so the second t‌ime you got it on it was Cosmic Ecstasy t‌ime, right?"

        "Not exactly," Emily confessed. "See, usually when I make love I have this problem."

        Yvonne patted her shoulder. "It just won't happen, huh?"

        "Sort of. If the guy's patient enough I can get real close but I just can't make it all the way. It's like my body doesn't
        know what to do next."

        "Baby, there ain't a woman breathing who don't know about that."

        "Yeah, but it gets stranger. If the guy's real good — and Victor and Boris both are — then I actually do get there, or
        right on the very edge of getting there."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not At All">
        <prolepsis>Yvonne was puzzled. "So what happens then?"

        Emily leaned her chin on her knees. "All sorts of trouble. I break into cold sweats. My hands go numb. My legs
        cramp up. If it's really bad — or really good, or whatever — I get short of breath and feel like I'm going to pass out.
        It used to happen all the t‌ime with Boris and I'd have to tell him to stop."

        "Aw, baby, that ain't good."

        "Yeah, well, I don't know about that."

        Yvonne frowned "Sounds like there's more to this story."

        "There is."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="But This Time...">
        <prolepsis>"I don't know what it was. Victor was gentle, he listened to me and he paid attent‌ion to my body. He seemed to care
        about the way I felt — and for real, not just because he was trying to prove something."

        Yvonne nodded, thinking about the best of the best. "And then...?"

        "And then I had him down there between my legs and I don't know, somehow it just didn't happen the way it always
        does. I didn't have time to think about it. I didn't not‌ice any of my usual problems. I didn't notice anything at all
        except for what happened, it was so sudden. One second I'm just starting to feel pretty nice, and the next he shifts
        just a little bit, and ..."

        "Sha—zoom."

        "It was like, it was like gett‌ing hit by real slow lightning."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Change Your Life">
        <prolepsis>Yvonne was smiling at her. "There's always a f‌irst f‌ime. I remember mine. It sure was something else." She thought
        about it for a bit. "But after that, I don't know. It's nice but it don't change your life. Makes you wonder sometimes
        why the men care about it so much."

        "I know," Emily mused, "but in a way it did change my life. It felt like something was different in me, like a door was
        pulled off its hinges or a wall had been punched through. I felt out of control. I started crying, just buckets and
        buckets of tears. At f‌irst Victor thought I was happy. He was holding me and kissing me and stroking my hair. And
        maybe I was happy. But I couldn't stop crying. Pretty soon I was bawling like a baby, you know, heaving up these
        big breathless sobs. I cried so hard that I threw up, and even when that happened I still couldn't stop crying and I
        nearly choked. It got scary. He didn't want me to leave but I made him take me home."

        "Girl, you got some problems."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not Again">
        "Maybe I do," Emily allowed. "I don't know what was happening to me. I felt kind of like you do after the f‌irst time
        you do it, like I'd lost something I could never get back. For days I kept seeing these f‌lashes of myself there on the
        bed with him while that happened to me."

        "That's called a fantasy," Yvonne pointed out. "Did it make you want him?"

        Emily shook her head. "I've always liked Victor, he's been a good friend. I hate myself for fucking up our friendship
        that way. He tried to see me again, he's written me letters over here. But I can't do it."

        Yvonne looked her hard in the face. "Goodness sake, child, why not?"

        "Because," Emily said, shutting her eyes, "I can't go through that again. It felt too much like dying."
    </div>

    <div title="Be Serious">
        He held her and she went on crying, not so sharply now but steadily, the tears st‌ill streaming out of her, more tears
        than he would have thought possible. It occured to him that he'd only seen her cry once before, on that strange f‌irst
        night. He felt connections beginning to form, connect‌ions he'd just as soon deny.

        "I never mean to scare you," he whispered, kissing her cheek. "Sorry, Blondie. Next time I won't wear the goalie's
        mask, I promise."

        She squeezed his forearm. "I'm trying to be serious Victor. Be serious with me."

        "Could I be serious about you? Would that do?"

        Evidently it wouldn't, because now the tears started up again in earnest. She went deep into it for a minute or two,
        going through long racking sobs, trying to reach something trying to push it out or let it go. Eventually she caught
        her breath.
    </div>

    <div title="Not Real">
        <prolepsis>"Victor, none of this is real," she said brokenly.

        He thought about that, a heavy foreboding beginning to grow in the pit of his stomach. "None of what?" he asked.
        "Graduate school? All these virtual systems games? The life and work of Mister Victor Gardner? — Yeah you're
        right, all that stuff is pretty much beyond belief." He was trying hard. He was gett‌ing nowhere.

        "You know what I mean," she said.

        He did know. So he lay there for a minute trying to pretend that he did not know what she meant, exactly what she
        meant. He wondered if he should start crying himself, though it didn't seem a very support‌ive thing to do. He
        settled for holding her t‌ighter and kissing her again, trying not to do what every foredoomed idiot who's about to
        lose the love of his life always does, namely, start obsessing about Finality.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Where Reality Begins">
        <prolepsis>Please please, he thought to himself, keep me from drawing up my Index of the Last.

        <fid>Was that the last time I will ever kiss her? If not the last, was it last-minus-N? Assuming the value of N to fall in a
        range f‌rom...</fid>

        Stop, he told himself. Try to think something constructive.

        "Run away with me," he whispered in her ear. "Let's just pack up and run away to the real world"

        "What world is that?"

        "You know, the place where people have cars and kids and mortgages. Where they only read books when they're
        on vacation, and then only Danielle Steele and Tom Clancy. Nowhere over the rainbow, someplace very real. Near
        Cincinnat‌i, I think."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Gardener">
        <prolepsis>"I'm serious, Emily. Let's you and me run away to the suburbs together. You can work for a regional bank and I can
        teach high school. We'll have a garden with peppers and zucchini and tomatoes. I'll wear Dockers and you can
        shop at Penney's. On Saturdays we'll weed the garden. We'll have two kids and we'll always vote Republican so
        when the kids grow up they can resent us and turn into Marxists."

        Not a bad try, all in all. Corny and predictable, but it came from the heart at least. A noble ef‌fort, too bad it came in
        such a lost cause. Victor knew it was a lost cause, and now he was scared too, scared by the magnitude of the pain
        that he knew would come from losing her.

        She was already up and pulling on her jeans, slipping back into her bra and sweater, padding of‌f toward the
        bathroom to try and unwind the knots from her hair.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Knots">
        <prolepsis><analepsis>Knots,</analepsis> Victor remembered, <analepsis>were once a form of writ‌ing used to keep track of stories, histories.</analepsis> That was what you
        got from graduate school, a head stuf‌fed with useless trivia that was no good at all in your darkest moments.

        Untie the knot, he thought, erase the past. Goodbye, Emily. Now he really did want to cry, but he was too much a
        man and too much a fool to let the tears come.

        "Emily," he called, but she didn't answer. He lay there in the bed still warm from her body, in sheets st‌ill rich with the
        smell of her, and he tried to form some idea of life without her.

        In a few minutes she came back and kissed him.</prolepsis>

        "I don't think I can do this." Victor was stubborn, planting his heels at the doorjamb and refusing to cross the line.
        Jude spun on one toe and faced him, the f‌ingers of her right hand crooked under the f‌ingers of his left. She put the
        bottle of tequila into his other hand. He took a smallish swallow.

        "Look," she invited, sweeping her f‌lee arm in a gesture of display. "You've never slept in a black bedroom before."

        "Aw Jude, come on." He tried to take his hand back but she held on, catching him off balance and coaxing him
        across the threshold. Before he could react she got behind him, crossing her arms over his shirt front. Her touch
        was excit‌ing but something in him felt resistant.

        "Don't be shy now. This is what you like, I know it is."

        "Jude, I can't."
    </div>

    <div title="Nails">
        <prolepsis>He made to pull away again but she wouldn't give up her hold. She slipped her left ring f‌inger inside his shirt,
        tracing the outline of his collarbone, delving down, tentat‌ively touching his right nipple. She felt his heartbeat pick
        up.

        "What color are my nails?" she breathed into his ear.

        "I didn't notice."

        "Yes you did. They're bone white. Just like —"

        "Don't do this, Jude."

        She kissed the side of his neck, nothing passionate, just a friendly touch of the lips. "Why not, Victor? Does it hurt
        you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Moralists">
        <prolepsis>He covered her hand with his own but didn't try to push her away. "Yes it hurts. All of this hurts."

        "Fine." She laid her head against his shoulder, stroking back and forth across his sternum. "Remember what they
        taught you when you were a kid: when it hurts, it's good for you."

        He turned and put his arms around her, an embrace with some warmth in it f‌inally. After all, they were friends.
        "Which are you, a Calvinist or a Sadist?"

        Jude laughed softly, holding his head against her cheek. "Come on and f‌ind out." But he was thinking no, she can't
        want this, what's the point? Thinking of turning away and walking out. Thinking of avoiding complicat‌ions, letting
        it be. Just say no.

        But he didn't say anything.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Lighting Up">
        <prolepsis>Victor set down the bottle and let Jude lead him a few more steps into her strange bedroom. The walls were indeed
        painted black, a glossy, almost lacquered black. Jude let go of his hand pulled the shades and started light‌ing
        candles all around the room. When she'd done the last one she switched off the overhead bulb. The candlef‌lames
        splashed the room with a murky light, twinned images dancing in the black depths.

        Twinned images: <fid>candles, yes, <analepsis>she'd brought him candles.</analepsis></fid> He shook his head as the memory bit into him. Jude
        really wanted to go all the way with this.

        She ran her f‌ingert‌ips lightly along the outsides of his arms. "Relax. I want you to trust me. Share with me. There's
        no one here but the three of us — you, me, and this ghost of yours." She took a step back, lifted the hem of her
        dress slightly. "Look what I'm wearing."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Hand Me Down">
        <prolepsis>It was a f‌ifties dress printed with big faded f‌lowers, made of some light f‌ilmy cotton, a little out of season. It fell in
        long simple lines that f‌it Jude's slight f‌igure.

        "You've seen me wear this before, right?" He nodded. "But you don't know where I got it. You don't know who
        gave it to me, years ago. You don't know who used to wear it before I did."

        Victor reached out, took the material of the sleeve between thumb and foref‌inger. Delicate, gauzy. More memories
        swarmed up and he turned away, but Jude put her hands around his forearm and drew him toward the bed. "It's too
        late now, way too late. You can't go back."

        She kissed him, reaching up on her toes to do it. He felt her tongue press into his mouth.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Haunting">
        <prolepsis>They lay on Jude's bed watching candlelight auroras skim across the ceiling. For a long while neither of them spoke
        or stirred. The mattress was stif‌f and a little caved-in, hard to share. As a rule, he knew, Jude slept alone. Victor
        shut his eyes, trying to f‌ind his place in this strange bed, this curious room. But he had trouble with it. He kept
        sliding back to another time and place.

        Jude was wise to the whole thing; that's why she'd taken him into her bed tonight. She undid the buttons on his
        shirt, ran her painted nails down into the hollow below his ribs. "You're really not here, are you?"

        He shook his head slowly, absently. "I'm stuck somewhere in the past. I'm sorry, Jude. It's getting so I can't even lie
        in my own bed anymore. I sleep on the f‌loor most nights."

        "You can't let go of her, can you?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Revisit">
        <prolepsis>"She won't let go of me."

        Jude slipped a deft f‌inger under the top button of his jeans and worked it loose. Victor took hold of her wrist.

        "Ssh," she whispered in his ear. "You don't get it. It's okay tonight, you don't need to worry. You can be anywhere
        you want." She slid her f‌ingers along under his beltline. "You can be with her if you need to."

        "Is that what you want?"

        Jude leaned over and kissed him again. Her mouth was warm and strong, its contours and pressures strange to him.
        "Close your eyes." She passed a hand over his eyelids. "Open up your memories. Tell me what you remember
        about her."</prolepsis>

    <div title="Missing">
        Emily snif‌fed the hooch and tried to pretend that it didn't smell an awful lot like acetone. "Okay, so let's lighten up.
        Think about back in the world. Think about sweet home. Tell me what you miss the most."

        Sergeant Yvonne giggled. "That one is dead simple." Emily rolled her eyes.

        "Now come on, Miss College Degree," the Sergeant chided, "you got those feelings too, I know you do. You a
        good ol' material girl even if you do look like that cold-ass bitch Muriel Streep. You gotta miss that thing just like we
        all do. But I don't mean just the strokin' and pokin,' at least not all by itself."

        Emily took another drink in hopes that it would kill the burn in her throat, but it only made it worse. "I know," she
        said. "I miss being touched. I miss being held."
    </div>

    <div title="Tender">
        <prolepsis>"You've got to have it tender." Yvonne pursed her lips and thought about it. "Waking up in the morning with your
        arms around your man, coming home to f‌ind him there. Being with somebody who don't spend all his time drooling
        over whore pictures and trying to get his hands down your pants. Somebody a whole lot different from these soldier
        boys. What these horny suckers want from you they can usually get inside of sixty seconds." She turned to Emily
        for conf‌irmation. "Look at this Runbird, look at her blushing! But you know how it is, girl, they get it in there for a
        minute or two then it's O-O-Omygod and they let their fat ass fall asleep on top of you. That's all you get outa them
        — bang-bang, shoot-shoot."

        "Yeah," said Emily, "sometimes I think you're lucky if that's all they want." She passed the bottle back.

        "Whatever," Yvonne shrugged.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Blackout">
        <prolepsis>Then just so no one would feel starved for entertainment, how about this. All the lights in the barracks suddenly
        snapped out and a new chorus of warning sirens started up. Filling in behind them came a babble of shock and
        anxiety.

        "Goddamn," Yvonne muttered. "What the fuck next?"

        The battery lamps cut on, harsh and actinic. For some reason they reminded Emily of the light bar on her father's old
        home movie rig and for an absurd moment she was kicked back to childhood. Reorienting she looked over and saw
        Yvonne in stark prof‌ile: cool and erect, checking out the scene. She found her left hand locked around the
        sergeant's knee and let go in embarrassment. Yvonne passed her the bottle.

        "We got incoming on the way," somebody yelled.

        "Kiss my ass," Yvonne sang back.</prolepsis>

        "Well isn't that special," the Whizzer remarked, "a handgun in New Jersey. Must've been some of that Conceptual
        Art. I hope it was at least wrapped in cellophane or something."

        "No. It was just this big blue .38 special sitting on the table in some kind of stand with wires and pulleys running
        out of it. So we walk over and we're having a look and Sasha says like, 'Is it loaded?' and the little Stevie guy says, 'I
        am instructed to tell you that at least one chamber is loaded.' Meanwhile I'm checking out the machinery and it's
        pretty clear that what we have is a trigger puller hooked into some kind of black box, could be a timer or a random
        number generator or a complete fake, who knows."

        "I think I'm starting to get it," the Whizzer acknowledged

        Dexter nodded. "So Sasha gives me this big hungry look that always gives me a hardon and she says: 'Want to give

    <div title="Point">
        <prolepsis>"Hold the sympathy," Dexter objected. "There's a point to this story, right?"

        "Is there?"

        Dexter ignored him. "It's like we're all gonna end up in that chair sooner or later. Everybody in America gets to be
        the Other Guy for f‌if‌teen minutes, or maybe longer. Doesn't matter if you go out and ask for it like the Marines, or if

        "Besides," Billy Van went on, accepting a cold one from Vance, Sigma Omega's entertainment coordinator, "th' way
        Ah reckon, tonight is a purty special occasion."

        Billy Van leaned out the window to tip his Stetson at a passing pickup wearing three yellow ribbons on its CB aerial.
        This time Vance took hold of the wheel before anything untoward happened.

        He resumed his seat. "Ah mean, ain't ever' night o' the year that a gawd-blessed shootin' war starts up."

        <prolepsis>They pulled out to pass a jeep f‌illed with sorority girls and nearly lost it as all the brothers pressed up to the
        starboard windows and the poor old bus canted over nearly past recovery.

        "Yeeee-ha," Billy Van whooped, understeering violently as they lurched into a curve. He was peering closely out
        the passenger's window. "Waitaminnit." He jammed on the brakes, which like everything else associated with the
        Rainbow Riders pulled vaguely to the left, so that the bus f‌ishtailed sprawlingly across its traff‌ic lane. Brothers and
        beercans went f‌lying toward the windshield, but there were no broken bones. The jeepload of sorority girls skidded
        by on the shoulder, giving them the collective f‌inger.

        "Sorry 'bout that," Billy Van apologized. "But it looks like we passed our turn. Vance, why'n'chew get out an' ask
        that tall skinny gal back there."</prolepsis>

    <div title="Say, Miss...">
        <prolepsis>"Aw shit," Vance objected, extricating himself from a pile of bodies under the dashboard. "I just hate asking
        directions. You do it."

        Billy Van called him six kinds of varmint but jammed the bus back into gear, swung around and blasted back
        eastward in the westbound lane of Lago Vista. He crunched to a halt opposite the pedestrian, leaned out and raised
        his hatbrim.

        "Evenin' miss."

        Leroy Sieger stared at this apppearance in the night, thinking oh shit next time only one mushroom. He was looking
        at a 1971 VW microbus standing wrongway round in the middle of the road. It was painted in a psychedelic style
        that owed more to Matt Groening than R. Crumb. Its driver was this sinister—looking guy in a string tie and
        hornrimmed glasses whose face reminded him of <analepsis>someone he'd seen on the tube.</analepsis> The fellow was squinting at Leroy
        in plain vexation.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Loose Lips">
        <prolepsis>Billy Van, who truth to tell needed his eyeglasses updated, realized his mistake. "Sorry feller. For a minute there Ah
        thought you was a heifer." He assumed an evil grin. "Y'all oughter think about gettin' a haircut maybe."

        Leroy f‌ished out his sunglasses and shoved them on, even though it was just past ten o'clock at night. He thought
        maybe this would make the Satanic Cowpoke go away, but no such luck.

        "Say, pardner," Billy Van went on, "could you tell me if that there road runs up to West Hills Circle?"

        Without thinking Leroy nodded, only then beginning to wonder why Billy Van Saxgutter and his Rodeo of Doom
        might want directions to the street where his mother lived.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Statement">
        <prolepsis>"Thanks kindly, stranger," Billy Van said, letting out the slippery clutch. "We'd offer you a ride but they's a bunch
        of us in here as 'tis." He paused a few feet further on. "An' anyways we don't give rides to no peckerwood faggots..."

        Somebody tossed a beer bottle in Leroy's general direction and the DisasterBus wallowed into an abrupt turn. Leroy
        sprinted after, feeling a spreading numbness in the pit of his stomach.

        "C'mon," he heard Billy Van Saxgutter say to his confederates, "we got us a statement to make."

        The bus rattled off with a sharp backf‌ire and a belch of burnt oil.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Irresistable">
        Thea was gazing at the back of the TV set, trying to climb above the infobabble but the stuff just got thicker. The
        local station was promising in-depth coverage at eleven.

        Veronica stared out the sliding door, listening to her inner voices and watching the night. "If there's going to be
        resistance," she said after a while, "there has to be something to kick against."

        Thea thought this over and saw that it was true. Something to kick against. What was there to resist, as Veronica
        herself had said, beyond the reality of the thing itself? She thought of <analepsis>Veronica's f‌irst response—This can't be
        happening, this isn't real...</analepsis>

        But it was real, undeniably real; or at least it was irresistibly present. It was hard to pull yourself out of that
        information loop, to get away from war as Event, war as Program. What had <analepsis>Leroy said?—that he could only know
        the war as television.</analepsis> Live from the Gulf! It's... DESERT STORM!

    <div title="Control Voice">
        <prolepsis>They all lived, she thought, in the Mondo Video — her own generation as much as Leroy's generation and
        Veronica's. Who could deny it? What would it mean to resist?

        For some reason Thea felt an old recollection bubbling up from deep memory. <analepsis>It was a sci-fi series she used to
        watch in her school days, the one that started each week with a test pattern, an oscilloscope trace, a picture of the
        moon. And yes oh yes The Control Voice. There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to
        adjust the picture.

        Thea knew even then that it was pure camp — Emie Kovacs meets the monster movies. We can make the image a
        shapeless blur... or give it crystal clarity.</analepsis> But that little voiceover came back to her tonight with a different spin. She
            could see now that it was <analepsis>the the truest thing ever said on the air.

    <div title="Attuned">
        We stumbled from room to room f‌licking on TV's, radios, tape decks, VCR's. It was technological potlatch, an
        offering of power to the gods, conspicuous consumption of information on an epic scale.

        While it was happening all we wanted was to be multiply channeled and networked. We needed to receive the event
        in black and white as well as full stereo surround. We yearned to hear all those voices around the dial, not out of
        distrust or skepticism so much as a hunger for input.

        It was a ref‌lex burned in <analepsis>somewhere between Dallas and the Sea of Tranquility.</analepsis> The event must be grasped in all its
        multiplicity, it must be broken down and remembered. We must match the frequencies, we must get in tune.

        It was happening for you there in the Gulf, unfolding in terms of death-by-routine or just mechanized boredom, the
        rush of engagement or the daily drag of uncertainty. You were strung out in a strange enclosure, a tenuous bubble
        of time and violence. In the words of "Hollywood" Huddleston, you wanted to free these Arab suckers so you
        could get back to being free yourselves.

        Meanwhile the folks back home had also crossed into another space, one that was windowed and projected,
        theorized and speculated, painted in the most graphic terms. But our world was different. You had your ass on the
        line, we had ours on the couch. None of it was real: we depended on that.

        Catastrophes are nation-forming, they weave networks in the air, they call communities into being, a thousand

        If the war became a video extravaganza, a game war, a ritual of revenge for Vietnam, a crusade against "tyranny"
        covering a rescue of greed — can you blame it on the ones who went? Remember,

        They honored their commitments.

        Which is more than anyone can say for the junk bondsmen, the merger artists, the overpaid image merchants, the

    <div title="1963 Facts">
        Threading back through memory's labyrinth Urquhart recalled <analepsis>an earlier turn in the road, another moment of strange
        arrival. Here were Mrs. Urquhart and her six-year-old son walking past the local draft board and all of a sudden it
        was time to hear about the American facts of life.

        What did you think life was about, Boris? Love and beauty, sport and amusement, spectacles of high f‌light. How
        nice, that's called innocence, enjoy it while you grow out of it.

        In Fact, life came tangled in mortal conditions and obligations. These were of two varieties, one proper to each sex.
        For women, the pain and jeopardy of childbearing; for men, the readiness to f‌ight and die in defense of the nation.
        As Mrs. Urquhart's experience so far included the Second World War and a couple of serious tries at a Third, she
        was inclined to take this obligation seriously.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="1975 Facts">
        <analepsis>History had its joke on Mrs. Urquhart, of course. In 1967 a gang of Jesuits torched the local draft board, an angry
        sign of the times. Young Boris, smart enough to know what Vietnam meant but not too bright about the ways of the
        world, went around for weeks thinking he was safe since his draft card had already been burned. He considered the
        event divine intervention and thought about the priesthood, though he was a Presbyterian.

        More of that innocence. His Uncle still knew where to find him if necessary, but in a sense young Boris was right.
        The crazy Jesuits had saved him. By the time he came to his fatal majority, Selective Service was in disgrace and
        Uncle was taking only volunteers.

        The crisis of his manhood was past, the world had veered down another path. There were new facts now.</analepsis>

        not writing I don't care how depressed she says she's been (tho what it is,
        I'm worried about her). Also remind Veronica (TRY anyhow) to pay the car
        insurance, which is the arrangement we have. She will probably ask you to
        help her out but this time please just say no.

        Same old routine around here, the heat's still a bitch and the grit gets
        everywhere including between your legs (yeah, just you think about that).
        Nobody in this outfit seems to think this will be a real war tho I guess
        we're ready if it is but look whos talking, a buncha mailmen.

        The Army is a diffrent planet, some kind of good fieldwork I guess but

        "The moustache. I don't know."

        "Give it a chance." He bends his upper lip, sniff‌ing fond memories. "It's just a baby."

        "It tickles. And it distracts me at the most important times."

        He shrugs. "Drives most women wild."

        Emily rolls of‌f the disreputable mattress, rises to her feet and then over into her morning cartwheel. She recovers

        Leroy was leaning against the sliding doors staring out into the quiet night. "I think I know the way you and Dad

        back absently and Thea started, seeing his father so clearly in that move. "There's something about the streets," he
        said.

        turn away from it. I've blamed you for going. I guess I've tried to blame

        But that was stupid</analepsis> and now it's time to own up, because tonight the shit's

        You're right, I'm your friend first and your teacher second. Which has been
        the problem. We don't agree, Emily, and I'm angry. But I care about you
        very deeply, know that.

        My head is full of conflicting feelings and <analepsis>I've banged my way through a
        dozen drafts to get to this letter,</analepsis> which doesn't work. There's no simple

        It's the last thing I'd ever have said, Emily, but <analepsis>you never sounded unsure.
        You knew.</analepsis> Get the job done, you say. Do your bit and come home.

        But the job is immoral, evil, and wrong. It means willingly taking part in

    <div title="Hopeless">

        Why was that? <analepsis>I must have talked to a half dozen students worried about the
        callups, men and women who said they weren't sure they ought to go. I did my

        explained it all to them, I got them in touch with the people who could
        really help.

        But you never sounded unsure, kiddo. You were sure. Get the job done, you
        say. Do your bit and come home. When you said that, I guess I just looked
        into your eyes and decided it was your way, let it be.</analepsis>

        Why didn't I try to change your mind? Why was I content to let you go? Why

    <div title="Playing Around">
        Being a woman is supposed to mean being an Other, little sister, and to me
        that Otherness isn't just negative | you can't define a woman as just the
        opposite of man. Otherness is something you have to do, a business. Being
        a woman means staying out of their games. It means you have to make up your
        own game.

        I know you go a lot farther with that whole postmodern thing than I do.
        Like that crazy Boris of yours you think everything's a game of some sort.
        You don't worry about what's unchangeable and final, outside the game.
        What's real, not simulated. You always figure you're going to get another
        chance, one more time on the field or something I can't do sports metaphors.

        I don't know how to explain this to you, Emily, but that's so fucked up. I
        really have tried to reach you, kiddo but I really can't understand and
        sometimes it's so hard for me, so heartbreaking to listen to you, to read
        what you've written to me

        I
    </div>

    <div title="Look in the Mirror">
        Then there's the women's issue, let's talk about that. This is something I
        really don't understand about you, Emily I | you're so eager to dress up like
        a soldier and play their mindfucking games. Okay, you like the job. So
        what.

        I don't understand why you don't just take a good look in the mirror, kiddo.
        Look at what you're doing for these people. Think about what it means.

        When you put on that uniform you don't just work, sweetie, you Serve. <analepsis>You
        took that oath, and you took it seriously. And when you did that, so far as
        I'm concerned, you sold out yourself | along with the rest of us who'd like
        to think that having a hard dick or a loaded gun doesn't give you the right
        to push the rest of the world around.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Women's Issue">
        Then there's the women's issue, and don't try to laugh that one off, little
        sister. It's less of a laughing matter every day now, what with Bush
        packing the Court and the rightwingers howling a little louder at each full
        moon.

        This is something I can't understand about you, Emily | why you're so eager
        to dress up like a soldier and play their boyscout games. I'm a tough old
        workingclass broad myself, I can understand that you like the job. Maybe
        I'm jealous of that. There are lots of times when I want to hang up this
        academic bullshit and do some honest sweaty nine—to—five.

        But you're not just on the line, honey, you're on the Team, and that's what
        I don't get. You don't just work for Uncle, you Serve. <analepsis>You took that oath,
        and you took it seriously.</analepsis> Part of me says good for you, there's not nearly
        enough honesty and commitment around these days. Part of me also thinks
        you're a sellout and a betrayer.
    </div>

    <div title="Otherness">
        Being a woman is supposed to mean being an Other, little sister. Vive la
        difference, just like the sexist bastards say. I admit I'm pretty
        hard—assed about it, but to me that Otherness isn't just negative | you
        can't define a woman as a not-an. Otherness is a positive demand, a
        business to be in, a business of being. Being a woman means going the other
        way, not joining their team, not wearing their uniform. It means staying
        out of their games. It means you have to find your own way.

        I know what you've written, I know you see this differently. Vive la
        difference, right. The whole postmodern thing makes sense to you, while you
        know that I think it's a lot of horseshit. Like that crazy man you sleep
        with, you think everything's a game. One big game and all of us players.

        You think you can change the game from the inside, don't you, you and Boris
        with all your talk about Chaos. You think that little twists and wrinkles
        can throw throw off their big System. Do you still think that now? Now that
        you're on the team?

    <div title="Come Home">

        figure the post office is very high on their hit lists. Just don't get

        here, not quite not here.

        You are looking very hard at the rainbow. Usually when you do that it will fade away. If you stare very hard without
        blinking the colors become less noticeable, they wander off somehow into other categories of aeriality and skyness.

        But this time when you gaze into the rainbow something goes wrong and the reality of its space does not diminish,
        rather it grows and substantiates and overwhelms you. You are staring into unspace, which is not a wise thing to
        do, because lo, the deeper you stare the more confused you become, the more dif‌icult you f‌ind it is to draw
        essential distinctions. You want to make this curious state of affairs go away, and now indeed you feel that

        You want to collect some counsel here, you want to phone in a question. What does War really mean, Walt? What
        was the Blitz like, or D-Day? Do we buy this Saddam=Hitler analogy or what? What do you really think about

    <div title="Hard Starter">
        Veronica moved on through the static bodies, dancing her dance as they went on watching their war.

        A public-address voice was heard in the White House press room and somehow, inadvertently, it got sent out live
        and nationwide. The voice announced a "9:01 Hard Start" for the President's address to the nation. Someone kept
        f‌licking the channels. No one seemed to notice.

        The words "hard start" rang in her head and wouldn't go away, and somehow she felt her dance growing more
        coherent drawing closer to its meaning. All at once she knew what she was doing.
    </div>

    <div title="The Dance">
        <prolepsis>They watched, Veronica danced. As the dance progressed, as it gathered toward a certain purpose, it took on a
        certain violence.

        She no longer brushed past them. She began to shove, to butt, to jostle. She drove her hips against their slack
        haunches. She stepped on their toes and arches, lightly at f‌irst but then with her whole weight.

        People began to murmur, a few even turned and swore at her, but they turned right back, locked in on the feed.

        A TV voice began to talk about plug-in air f‌resheners.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Exit">
        <prolepsis>Faster and faster she danced, slam-dancing, bruising the people she collided with, bruising her own f‌lesh.

        It was an astonishing performance, a real shocker. But it was also the sort of outburst for which bars like the Just
        Say No hire second-string football players.

        Veronica's dance ended in the arms of Taron J. Fletcher, a mediocre linebacker with much better prospects as an
        attorney, who applied as gentle a headlock as he could manage and showed Veronica the way back to East Main
        Street.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Lucy Reasons">
        Sometimes Lucy was a voice on the telephone as well as in her head, and Veronica knew she would be calling soon.
        The call would come partly out of concern about Emily and the war, but there would be Lucy reasons as well.

        Lucy reasons, like Thea's politics, had to do with plots and big stories. People of this generation seemed to need big
        stories to hold their lives together, to orient themselves. <analepsis>Lucy had gone through a number of these stories in the
        time Veronica had known her.

        Lately she was less concerned with the stories themselves than with the way they all ended.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Rock of Faith">
        <analepsis>Floating in the draf‌ts and eddies of the New Age, Lucy had lately fetched up on a strange rock of faith: the Church
        of Mutual Assured Rapture, a fellowship born from the union of charismatic Christianity and the military-industrial
        complex.</analepsis>

        It was a natural, even inevitable alliance, given the cultural logic of the sunbelt. You could look at this strange little
        sect as one more attempt to reconcile God with Caesar (or his modern equivalent, General Dynamics). Or you could
        just be cynical and write of‌f the CMARs (as they called themselves) as apocalypse freaks.

        <analepsis>Most of them, like Lucy, had indeed put in their time under the Freak f‌lag;</analepsis> and it's true, they were very fond of
        apocalypse. Along with their testimony and pentecostalism the CMARs liked to screen old disaster pictures,
        from When Worlds Collide and On the Beach to Earthquake (in the original Sensurround) and The Day Af‌ter.
    </div>

    <div title="Last Days">
        Now, we all know what the Bible says about motion pictures; but the CMARS' cinematic obsession implied no
        idolatry. To Lucy and her fellow sectarians, disaster cinema was a special, postmodern revelation.

        They met in Saturday night conventicles and subjected each f‌ilm to careful exegesis, probing for patterns,
        correspondences, and evidence of a secret Text. They made slides of stills and cut footage into their own montages.
        <analepsis>Lately Lucy had begun to talk about interactive video discs and something called hypermedia.</analepsis>

        Veronica didn't understand any of it, though she suspected that Thea would tune right in. Like most sixties
        survivors — and like all humanists — the CMARs believed that art expressed a single idea, in their case an image of
        the Last Days.

        Needless to say, the Gulf War was made for them.

        "Last night something really frightening happened," Harley related. "Last night the dream seemed longer and more
        exhaustive than ever, I seemed to be examining my own body down to the last follicle and nose hair."

        "I'd say you've spent a bit too much time on camera," Urquhart speculated.

        "Yeah, could be. Only listen to this. The more I saw of my body, the more convinced I became that it wasn't really
        mine."

        Urquhart shrugged. "Sounds like one of those postmodern moments to me. I am not I. Being as paradox. Sign in,
        stranger, sous rature."

        The grackle made an unappreciative noise and went back to work on their canteloupe.
    </div>

    <div title="With Open Eyes">
        <prolepsis>"Whatever that means. But wait, this is the really scary part. At the end of the dream my eyes actually came open
        and they stared right at me. Only, the eyes in that body weren't my eyes. They were these bright baby-blues."

        "Yeah, well, okay, weird. I admit that might put me off my medication for a while."

        "But that isn't the scary part."

        Urquhart nodded. "Somehow I didn't think so."

        "The scary part is that when I woke up, my eyes — this pair here — really were open."

        Urquhart tossed half the melon over the terrace rail and the grackle took off after it. "Gee, and they're such a lovely
        shade of blue, too."

        "Not funny."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Capitol">
        Harley felt naked without his camera crew; he kept trying to adjust his lighting, which wasn't easy when your sole
        source of illumination was the noonday sun. Like a smoker gone cold turkey he was troubled by hand memories —
        there was this hollow place in his right palm where the baton mike should have been. He stood there on the line of
        march f‌idgeting, holding up his little recorder and feeling a right fool.

        He wasn't even supposed to be here. Harley was officially on leave, temporarily on waivers, consigned to the
        emotional Disabled List. He was supposed to be taking long walks. <analepsis>That was what the Company Shrink told him
        when he dropped by the Phoenix off‌ice for evaluation.</analepsis> Take long walks and avoid stimulants. Alcohol in
        moderation. Maintain a high-f‌iber diet. Practice safe sex.

        <fid>One out of f‌ive, well at least that was a start.</fid>
    </div>

    <div title="Eyewitness">
        <analepsis>So he took a long walk. Well, long by Washington standards anyway, all the way from Urquhart's townhouse on
        East Main to the steps of the Capitol of the Commonwealth, the better part of twelve blocks. He was just an idler out
        for a stroll this f‌ine January morning, soaking up some of that sunbelt sunshine and airing out his head. Sure he was.

        <analepsis>"You're going to that peace march, aren't you?" Veronica said as he tried to slip out.

        "Yeah, where's my 'No Blood For Oil' poster?"

        She got up from the word processor and met him at the doorway, arms crossed, skeptical in the extreme. "You're not
        marching. You just like to watch."

        He leaned over and nibbled her lower lip, beginning to entertain second thoughts. "Hey that's me, remember. I
        Witness News."</analepsis></analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Back in the Saddle">
        <prolepsis>"Here," she said, handing him her microcassette recorder. "Get some nice sound bites."

        He hugged her, feeling her long slim arms on his shoulders, unaccountably strong. "I don't have to go."

        "Of course you do, Harley." She gave him a long kiss and then backed away. "If you don't you'll just sit around the
        house and watch the tube, and that drives me nuts. Go out and get some air."

        "Okay, mom."

        "Though I know you, what you really want is airtime." She tried to tweak his rear but he was already through the
        door, pulling on his walking coat, f‌ishing out his press card, checking to see if the recorder had batteries. Back in
        the saddle again.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="March">
        <prolepsis>So here he stood on the line of march as the protesters f‌iled past with all the usual slogans, We Won't Fight for
        Texaco, Give Peace A Chance, Just Say No To War. There looked to be about f‌ive hundred in the line, most of them
        white and well dressed: a young crowd, obviously from the University, with a few Movement veterans sprinkled in.

        A counterdemonstration was in progress on the other side of the Capitol plaza, thirty or forty military dependents
        down from Fort Arnold with f‌lags and bullhorns, doing their best to make up in volume what they lacked in numbers.
        There was the usual shouting and posturing when the two groups got within range of each other, but Harley was
        surprised at the lack of hostility or real passion. Maybe it was that southern instinct for politeness, maybe it was the
        relative youth of the marchers, whose generation was unused to politics in the street.

        The handful of mounted cops sat in their saddles patiently, looking bored.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Encounter">
        <prolepsis>Harley was just about to pack it in and see if he could coax Veronica out for lunch at Mi Madre when a f‌igure coming
        down the Capitol steps caught his eye. A big guy in a voluminous trenchcoat, shoulders slightly hunched, fat
        briefcase tucked under his arm, blond mop tossing in the plaza breeze. What a surprise.

        Harley slipped around the police line in his best Working Press style, strolling up casually on the big man's blind
        side. When he got close enough he reached out and seized his free wrist.

        "Doink!"

        Thinking, Jesus not another pissant, Gerry Madden turned and made the ID. Which caused him to revise his
        impression.

        "Harley Morgan! What the hell are you doing in this town?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Lunch Hour">
        <prolepsis>"Not a whole lot," Harley confessed. "How about you, got time for lunch?"

        Madden looked at his watch, considering. His afternoon was going to be dominated by a Regional Security Task
        Force meeting, three and a half hours of interlocking bureaucracies, little wheels within big wheels, all careful
        designed to go nowhere. This would be followed by some compensatory unwinding down at the John Law. He
        didn't see why he couldn't front-load a little of that unwinding. Call it good stress management.

        "You're buying," Madden told him. "You still owe me from Frankfurt."

        Harley acknowledged the debt and they set off down Congress Boulevard toward the quick-and-inexpensive belt.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Screwups">
        <prolepsis>They found a Mexican place that didn't really do Mexican food and sat over bowls of gazpacho and French bread,
        washed down with some good local beer. "So," Madden said after they toasted old times, "how did you screw up?"

        Harley peered at him from under the lowered brim of his porkpie hat. "Jeez, Madden."

        But he knew. They both knew. Running into each other here and now, the thought was unavoidable. Each of them
        must have screwed up. Otherwise Harley would be someplace like Baghdad or Amman, hazardous to his health but
        good for his career, and Madden would be pounding some real turf, Chicago or Miami, not cooling his butt in this
        sleepy little town.

        "I told them I wouldn't go," Harley explained.

        Madden looked at him. "No shit?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Comrades">
        <prolepsis>Madden took a bite from his baguette, handling it like a hotdog bun. "I'm assuming you had a reason," he probed.

        Harley nodded. "I'm burned out, stressed to the max, old before my time."

        "I guess there's some truth in that," Madden allowed, trying the soup. "But mainly it's bullshit. What's the real
        reason?"

        So much for bullshit. Harley and Madden were old acquaintances, veterans of <analepsis>many stings, scams, and coverups.
        They'd met ten years ago when Harley was a Washington rookie assigned (with sadistic laughter behind his back) to
        crack the story of racism inside the FBI. Partly because he wanted to shake the tree, partly because he liked Harley
        and trusted him, Madden had leaked an Inspector General's report. The tree took a heavy shaking and Madden
        didn't fall as far as he'd feared, partly because Harley covered his tracks expertly. So began a long and prof‌itable
        friendship.</analepsis></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Where's the Story?">
        <prolepsis>"The real reason," Harley mused, "is that I think the war is not the main story. Why should I go to Bahrain or Saudi
        when the big story is right here in the good old U.S.A.?"

        Madden broke a chunk off Harley's half-uneaten baguette. "And just what is this big story on the homefront? You
        can't mean all that Stop the War shit we saw down at the Capitol this morning."

        Harley shook his head. "Nah. The whole thing's being managed too carefully. The opposition is just a media show
        so far."

        "Okay," Madden agreed, "so where's the story?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Tough">
        <prolepsis>Harley leaned back, looking out at the lunchtime strollers along Congress.

        "Well you might start with those two empty of‌f‌ice buildings across the street, one of which just got foreclosed last
        week. Got any idea what the national vacancy rate is for of‌f‌ice property? Or what the housing market's been doing
        back in New England? Or the banks —"

        "Yeah, right, things are tough all over. There's a recession, in case you didn't notice."

        He turned up his palms. "But gee, Gerry, your big white chief says the recession won't last the winter."

        Madden winced. "Yeah, I heard that one." He f‌inished his beer. "And I've got to agree with you, we're in for some
        long hard times in this country. We've been living too high for too many years, all of us."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Which Dream">
        <prolepsis>Harley looked around the restaurant. The lunch rush was over now and half the tables were still clean and empty.

        "It had to stop somewhere, I guess. But you know me, Geny, I've got this thing for the big trends. I like to think
        about the impliations. What happens to this society once the money dries up? Okay, we have to face the real world.
        But what happens to our dreams, huh?"

        Madden snorted. He had a zero cliche tolerance. "Shit, Harley, you stayed in TV way too long. Don't start with that
        'American Dream' bullshit. House and car and wife and kids and a word from our sponsors. If you got any smarts at
        all you know that one broke down about 1974."

        "That wasn't the dream I was talking about."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Happy Birthday">
        <prolepsis>Madden raised an eyebrow. "I'm not following you."

        "You got that right." He gave him a very sharp look. "So tell me Gerry, what happens on January 15?"

        He gave a little shrug. "My guess is, Saddam turns tail and pulls out. Or else he tries to dick around with the
        deadlines some more and we have to scare him with airstrikes. But I don't think there's going to be a war, if that's
        what you're asking."

        "No, Gerry, that wasn't what I was asking. Try again. What happens on January 15. Every fucking year, Gerry."

        A blank look at f‌irst, then he made the link. "Uh oh."

        "It's the day we celebrate somebody's birthday, Gerry. Remember? Remember who?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Tara">
        The city of Tara, deep in the heart of the Commonwealth of Tara, contains 450,000 souls, a major research university,
        the Commonwealth Congress, many excellent taverns, cafes, and night spots, several million bats, and statues of
        Elvis Presley and Jef‌ferson Davis.

        The Davis statue dominates a long plaza near the gates of the University, where <analepsis>it has become something of an
        embarrassment. Recently the Trustees commissioned a statue of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., which they
        erected at the other end of the plaza. The statue was to be dedicated on the 15th of January, but events in the Gulf
        forced a postponement.

        Last time I looked, the cloths were still on.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="John Law">
        Special Agent Madden was not enjoying this new assignment.

        To begin with, he felt no great love for Tara. The town had a low-rent-tornado-alley feel to it, like a bad dream of the
        sunbelt. He kept coming across buildings that seemed ready to fall down or blow away. When he went for his daily
        orientation cruise he passed dead malls and retail zones where plywood was far more common than plate glass.
        Everybody he met had a house to sell, or two.

        Then you had the drinking establishments, which seemed to combine all the worst excesses of a college town with a
        fanatical emphasis on "local music." Madden, who could just barely tolerate Sinatra and a few show tunes, didn't
        much like the local music. So like many others in his line of work, he wound up by default on the wrong side of the
        river, down at that old roadhouse called the John Law Bar.
    </div>

    <div title="Colleagues">
        <prolepsis>There was a distinctly Federal f‌lavor to the John Law tonight, a lot of guys in town for grand jury following up on a
        major ATF action some months back. Madden realized he knew most of the room. Even the Secret Service was
        represented. Snyder the Bushwhacker caught sight of him and mugged evasive action. Snyder owed both the
        epithet and his indef‌inite posting to Idaho to <analepsis>the time in '81 when he got a bit too enthusiastic trying to coax a
        deerf‌ly off the backside of one of the Vice President’s grandchildren.</analepsis>

        "Hey Snyder. Still beating up on those rich white kids?"

        "These days, only when I get it in writing." Snyder tried unsuccessfully to get the bartender's attention. Being a
        regular, Madden had better luck

        "And how 'bout yourself Madden, still got that Coach's Clicker down in your pocket?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Cybercrimes">
        <prolepsis>"Naw, Snyder, just my car keys and beeper." Their drinks showed up and they lif‌ted their glasses to the usual, A
        Return To Sanity. One of these days, maybe.

        "So Gerry, what's new in your shop?"

        Madden scratched his jaw. "Nothing to speak of. Aggravation. S.O.S."

        "I heard you got stuck with some of that new Task Force hoo-ha — what's that called? — 'cybercrime?' — Jeez, it
        sounds like a comic book."

        Madden winced. "Comic books" had been a sore subject in the Bureau since the end of the Hoover days. "Yeah.
        Mickey Mouse in the 21st Century. Somebody’s been traipsing through a secure D-o-D network, and the folks in
        charge think it's serious. Probably some twelve-year—old doesn't even know what he's into. Shit, Snyder, they ought
        to put you on the case."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="10:59">
        <prolepsis>Behind the bar the TV was showing hardware in action again, M-l tanks erupting through some sand berms, a
        battery of 155's spitting smoke into the sky. For a second Madden thought it was some kind of Volunteer Army ad,
        then he had a look at the clock and realized that with a minute till eleven this was no "Be All That You Can Be" hype,
        it was increasingly serious. Today was the 15th of January and there were 60 seconds to go on Mr. Bush's deadline.

        "So here it comes," he said.

        Snyder shrugged and gave a thumbs-up. "Good to go, as they say in the Scouts these days," Snyder replied. "At
        least we know what the f‌uck we're getting into. Gonna be dif‌ferent this time."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Even Up">
        <prolepsis>"Is that what this is about?" Madden wondered, working at his scotch. "They didn't get the plan down back in
        those old jungle days, so now we get a second chance?"

        Snyder smiled. "Well ain't that just the American way these days?" Then he turned on him a look that went back
        over darker ground. "But you know what we're talking about. You were there."

        Madden thought about it. "I guess I was. But what kind of fool would ever want to go back?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Questions">
        <prolepsis>Madden paused a while, searching out the right words. "Hey Snyder, tell me something. Do you feel okay about
        this war?"

        Snyder shrugged. "Ask me again when they start calling back the f‌ifty-year-old vets."

        The sports came on and the bar fell into a kind of disbelieving silence while the local analyst explained how the
        University of Tara could still be taken seriously after <analepsis>losing 46-3 in the Citronella Bowl.</analepsis>

        Snyder cycled back. "Why shouldn't I feel okay about this war?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Rolling Stock">
        <prolepsis>"Let me put it this way — what are you driving these days?"

        Snyder held up his keys. "Mercury Grand Mark. It ain't my old 442, but then my driver's license says I'm not
        twenty-five anymore, either."

        Madden nodded. "You're a cop, cops always drive cruisers. But have you had a look at the civilians lately? Christ,
        even the fucking Japanese are selling V-8's now. I go down to Wal-Mart and it's like driving around in some kind of
        time warp."

        Snyder shrugged his beefy shoulders.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Don't Worry">
        <prolepsis>"So?" Snyder challenged. "What's a matter, you trying to tell me you voted for the other guy in '80?"

        Madden shook his head "No, I was all the way with Reagan just like everybody else. Morning in America, sure. I
        just wonder where all this high living is going to leave us in about twenty years. And it isn't just the gas, come on,
        it's the junk bonds and the S&amp;L's and the FDIC too."

        Snyder got hold of his neckbones and gave them a fraternal shake. "You like to worry, or what? Okay, so we got a
        few problems. In case you didn't notice, this country has always been fucked up one way or the other. We work it
        out, we manage, always have. The last word in American is I CAN, all that shit."

        "And is that what the war's about?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Testify Memory">
        "You remember, don't you?" Heidel said again, and suddenly something about the voice clicked for Madden. The
        old pathways reconnected, some very stale neurons f‌ired up after decades on idle. "Edison," he said.

        Heidel bobbed his sleek chin ever so slightly, a minimal acknowledgement. "I might have used that name once."

        <analepsis>He might have used it (among others), in Berkeley in 1968. He might have used it in Oakland ten years later when he
        met with a rookie f‌ield agent to pass along evidence leading to the capture of two persons later convicted of
        kidnapping, bank robbery, possession of explosives.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Heavy">
        <prolepsis>"That was what we used to call in the vernacular some heavy shit," Madden pointed out.

        "It was important work," Heidel allowed. "Somebody had to do it; and I had debts to pay."

        <analepsis>It was,</analepsis> Madden recalled, <analepsis>the kind of debt that had nothing to do with money.</analepsis>

        "It was heavy enough shit that some individuals might have considered Witness Protection," Madden said. "But if
        you'd gone that route, then I doubt we'd be having this little chat right now."

        Heidel shrugged. "I managed."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Managing">
        <prolepsis>"You managed. Would you care to elaborate on that?"

        "I got married," Heidel related. "My wife's family is very prominent in this state. They helped me get my life back in
        order, in many more ways than one."

        Madden added a page or three to the mental f‌ile. "Just out of curiosity, what was your wife's maiden name?"

        "Baumann."

        "As in Larry S. Baumann?" As in oil, newspapers, politics, and a couple of interesting S&amp;L's.

        "A man I've always looked up to."</prolepsis>

    <div title="See No Evil">
        It was early October, a week or so after <analepsis>Urquhart watched her get on that bus to Fort Benning,</analepsis> a few days into his
        life of unforeseen solitude. Or what he thought was solitude. He stumbled out of bed that morning headed for the
        bathroom, tripped over something, or rather someone, and fell headlong in the hallway.

        "Harley? What the f‌uck, you're supposed to be in Bahrain."

        He was sleeping in his clothes in the middle of the f‌loor, his usual preference in times of crisis. There was a nearly
        empty bottle of vodka beside him. Urquhart f‌inished it of‌f to clear his head.

        "Not me," Harley muttered, still down in his dreams.

        "If you say so."
    </div>

    <div title="Story of Your Career">
        <prolepsis>It took them about an hour to get around to the facts of the case. For a while they just sat on Urquhart's terrace
        looking down on the East Main drag watching the non-students straggle down to Hassenfuss' Deli for angst and
        cappucino. Urquhart cut open a canteloupe and together they stared at it.

        "I talked to Fitzmaurice," Harley said f‌inally. This was his executive producer in Atlanta. "I told him hell no I won't
        go."

        A big grackle f‌luttered onto the breakfast table and helped them stare down the melon. Urquhart sighed. "This is of
        course the story of your career." He heard what he had said. "In both senses."

        Harley spread his hands. "What choice did I have? They canceled 'Bounty of Shame.' They said Desert Shield
        made it temporarily irrelevant."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Bounty">
        <prolepsis><analepsis>"Bounty of Shame" was a documentary Harley had been working on as a long-deferred reward for his duty in the
        Mideast. It was to be an extended series on the new American underclass — not just the urban homeless so popular
        with the cameras, but the people in the suburbs who managed (barely) to meet their payments with no prospect of
        improvement. He was f‌ilming displaced factory workers and middle managers, solid citizens who found themselves
        working temporary or part-time jobs, moonlighting to cover self-paid health insurance, thinking about food stamps.
        He'd just interviewed a couple in Indiana who'd given up the family car and some newlyweds in Ohio who thought
        they'd never be able to af‌ford kids.

        He meant to go beyond symptoms to broader causes and ef‌fects — the downward wage pressure generated by
        overseas competition, the demise of organized labor and coalition politics, the hyperinf‌lation of housing prices and
        the collapse of the S&amp;L's</analepsis>. But now it wasn't happening.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Leave It">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart squinted at the grackle as it pecked breakfast. "Temporarily. At least they said temporarily."

        Harley snickered. "So I told them I could be temporarily unemployed. Fitzmaurice said they'd call it 'stress leave.'"

        Urquhart tried to shoo the bird away. It made a noise like a broken bus transmission and would not stir. "In your
        case," he pointed out, "'stress leave' is an oxymoron."

        "I've been having strange dreams," he said. He was silent for a while, rubbing his brow.

        "Oh well," Urquhart answered, "that explains it."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Have a Dream">
        <prolepsis>"Have you ever seen your own body in a dream?" Harley asked him.

        Urquhart thought he had, though it was usually in the company of six blonde volleyball players, all absolutely alike,
        and he claimed he hadn't had that particular dream since he was seventeen. <analepsis>(In fact he'd had it the night before last.)</analepsis>

        "All right. But have you ever dreamed your own body. Bit by bit, limb by limb. From the insides out or the outsides
        in. As if it were being constructed, or reconstructed."

        "Can't say as I have, no."

        The grackle put its head on one side and looked at Harley quizzically. "The scariest thing about it," he noted, "is
        that it's progressive. Each night it's a little more advanced, a little more detailed."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Stringer">
        They're both up and somehow Harley manages to get into the whole outf‌it — coat, tie and the porkpie hat (useful in
        all kinds of contingencies) — before she's got her sweater untangled from the bedclothes. More of those tricks of
        the trade. He waits semi-patiently by the door, eyes on the feed.

        Somehow they both know the plan without discussion. Harley's of‌icially on "stress leave" but quick study that she
        is, Veronica's learned that neither of those words mean anything when History dials your pager. It's the birth of a
        stringer.

        He's heading out to Cover the Story, whatever that may turn out to mean here in Tara. He's thinking a college
        town deep in the heart of the Sunbelt, this could get interesting. Veronica's telepathically adding yeah and good
        luck without your trusty local guide to point you down the right streets.
    </div>

    <div title="No Go">
        <prolepsis>At the door they exchange a quick but laden glance. "Where do we start?"

        "The No," she tells him.

        And they're off.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Music?">
        <prolepsis>Veronica stalled with one foot over the threshold, causing Harley to bump against her shoulderblades. Something
        wasn't right here. It rolled right up and hit her in the face.

        "No music?" Harley noticed, a beat late.

        Absence is presence. There was not a trace of melody in the No tonight, there was not even a snatch of rhythm
        from some gigless drummer working out a solo on the side of his beer glass. Everybody at the bar seemed stuck in
        some kind of f‌it, staring up through gathering webs of passive smoke at the common screen.

        "The threat of chemical attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia." Tom Brokaw greeted them.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="The Other Guy">
        Dexter stretched out, trying three or four increasingly awkward positions before he convinced himself there was no
        such thing as comfort in a chemical warfare suit. "Say Whizzer," he said f‌inally, "you remember those old
        commercials about defensive driving — the ones that said 'Watch Out For The Other Guy?"

        "Yeah, they were rich. We know you're okay, but that sucker in the next lane, uh oh."

        "Right." Dexter agreed. "What I could never f‌igure out was, if the commercial is meant for all of us, then who the
        fuck is this Other Guy?"

        "Hang it up, Dex. The Army don't need philosophers." The Whizzer fumbled in his pack for a cube of nicotine gum.
        Like a few thousand of his fellow desert troopers, he was rethinking his dependencies.

        "The thing is, I think I f‌inally know who the Other Guy is," Dexter went on.
    </div>

    <div title="The Other Us">
        <prolepsis>"Lemme guess — Saddam Hussein? Dan Quayle? Rodney Dangerf‌ield? Or could it be that state trooper you
        think's been bangin' your old girlfriend?"

        Dexter shook his head in sublime disregard. "It's none other than you and me."

        "Gee, how original."

        "Laugh but it's true. Look, the Other Guy isn't just the one that fucks up, he's the one all the shit happens to. The
        one that gets herpes and tax audits. The guy whose trailer is always in the path of the funnel cloud. The one gets
        clipped at Burger King when some burnout grabs an assault rif‌le."

        "So? I don't live in no trailer."

        Dexter gave this unhealthy giggle. "The fuck you don't. Examine your surroundings."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="War Hole">
        <prolepsis>The Whizzer had a look around the bivouac. "Okay, so it ain't the Beverly Hilton. Just what are you getting at,
        Dickster?"

        "This war is our chance to be The Other Guy," Dexter explained. "It makes sense. This is the way we're all gonna be
        in the nineties. Remember how Andy War Hole said everyone's supposed to get f‌ifteen minutes of fame? Well
        some fucking genius he was, he got it wrong. It's not f‌ifteen minutes of fame, it's f‌ifteen minutes of fear."

        The other man considered. "In that case can I go home now? Seems like my f‌if‌teen minutes must be up."

        "Let me tell you a story," Dexter said.

        "Oh mercy."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Dexter's Story">
        <prolepsis>"When I was back in Jersey I was hung up on this girl named Sasha Meninger," Dexter recounted. "She was a real
        classy number, kind of like the Runbird only spacier."

        "Jeez Dex, I hope this is not gonna be one of your I-caught-her-in-bed-with-another-
        guy stories."

        "Actually it was another girl, but that ain't the point." Dexter f‌ished out a water bottle and took a long swig for
        irrigation. "I was trying like hell to impress her. She hung with this bunch of art students from Pace, most of them
        were in a band called Machine Vomit."

        "Oh yeah. They covered 'Born to Run' with a trombone and accordion arrangement. I heard it at a party once and it
        actually made me puke."

        "Yeah, right, anyway."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="No Such Place">
        <prolepsis>"Anyway," Dexter persisted. "I was so hot to get into her Calvins I woulda done just about anything, which turned
        out to include going to this weird sort of art gallery in Fort Lee or someplace."

        "There's no art galleries in Fort Lee."

        "Exactly. We get to the door and this guy with a ponytail comes over, he looks just like Steven Seagall except he's
        only f‌ive-three. Get this, he actually cards us. To get into a frigging art gallery, he cards us. Says there's this policy
        you gotta be 21 to get inside because of the special nature of the exhibit."

        "Oh I get it. Some of that suck-my-dick performance art, right?"

        Dexter gave him the narrow eye. "What are you, Whizbang,. a closet fag? So anyway he gives us some papers to
        sign and then we bop on in."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Guess What?">
        <prolepsis>"Papers?" the Whizzer wondered.

        "Yeah — these real strange release forms. 'I agree not to hold the owners of these premises responsible for any and
        all bodily harm that may come to me as a result of my voluntary interaction with the aforementioned works of art.'
        Something like that."

        "Weird shit."

        "So we go in and we're in this dark room. I mean real dark, except there's this one spot focused on a little table and
        chair. There's this machine of some kind on the table, and when I get closer I just about shit myself cause I see what
        it is."

        "A giant pneumatic dildo."

        "No, shit-for-brains: a gun."</prolepsis>

    <div title="Lighten Up">
        After making sure there were no off‌icers in the vicinity, Sergeant Yvonne opened her footlocker and came out with
        her very special water bottle. She took a little pull, wrinkling her eyes and swallowing hard, then passed it over.
        Party girl to the last, Emily went for a bigger hit. And instantly regretted it.

        The Sergeant set her broad shoulders back. "If we're gonna sit around waiting for the fucking bombs to fall, the last
        thing I want to talk about is what kind of fucking bombs."

        Emily tried another jolt. The stuff made her f‌ingernails numb. "Right."

        Sarge f‌lapped the collar of her chemical suit, trying to work out a little positive ventilation. "What I want is to
        lighten up."
    </div>

    <div title="Thea &amp; Harley">
        Thea knows that Veronica's been sleeping with Harley Morgan. Harley who, <analepsis>back in another set of scuf‌flings, was
        her own lover for more than a year.</analepsis> Did Veronica know about that, and would it mean anything to her? <analepsis>It went back
        almost a decade.</analepsis>

        She remembers <analepsis>how Harley was then: high-strung and full of rage, his moods all edges and angles. It was his f‌irst
        tour in Washington and he was catching on fast. He was learning the trade and at the same time how much he hated
        it. She was in the early days of her divorce then, doing consulting on the Hill and thinking about a law degree.

        Sex, when they managed it, ended up paradoxical. Harley was patient, attentive, very clever with his hands. Thea
        was usually all those things and more, but in those days she was abstracted, still too heavily committed to her own
        defenses. Harley wanted to innovate and improvize; Thea just wanted to get down to it, f‌inish more or less together,
        have a cigarette.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Glorious">
        They lay together with the tube off for once.

        Harley was f‌loating, Veronica was still charged from the rush of her climax. Her skin tingled. He laid his cheek
        against her shoulder and took in the sweet sharp reek of her. She felt his come cooling on the inner curves of her
        thighs, a slow trickling reminder. <analepsis>With all her other lovers she'd been squeamish about it, up and off to the shower
        as soon as he was done.</analepsis> Not with Harley, though. She guessed she was growing up.

        "You're glorious," he breathed to her. He wanted to say something more, it was on the tip of his tongue, but the time
        didn't seem right.

        "Glorious," she repeated, more or less in simple agreement.
    </div>

    <div title="Sticky">
        <prolepsis>She ran a f‌inger along the curve of a thigh, gathering up the traces of him, then passed her f‌inger over his belly
        down below the navel. Giving a little back.

        "Sticky," Harley noticed.

        "Just wanted you to know what it's like on my side of the bed, partner." Putting on the Hardheaded Woman for a
        second.

        Harley gently f‌ingered her nearest nipple. Not to be distracted, Veronica did the same to him. So they both got
        distracted.

        "Hm."

        "So what's it like for you?" she asked, taking him in her arms.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="It'll Come to Me">
        <prolepsis>"What's what?" he said back, having a certain amount of trouble sustaining the focus here.

        "You know what. Coming. What's it like for a man?"

        Harley made to kiss her but she slipped out of the embrace. "What is this, a little thesis research for that
        Ethnography of Gender class?"

        She swung her legs across him, making an overture she knew he couldn't refuse. "Answer the question," she said in
        his ear. Nibbling.

        "Oh well, gee, it's um... Wait a sec, it'll come to me."

        "Not so fast."

        "Aw."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Hippie Chick">
        <prolepsis>"What do you think about when it happens?" Veronica asked him, gently grazing his collarbone with the tips of her
        breasts, holding herself otherwise aloof.

        "You," Harley said truthfully. "You, you, glorious you."

        She paused, tracing her f‌ingernails down his ventral line. "You don't see things?"

        He considered. "Stars sometimes. When I get carried away and hit my head on the bedstead."

        "I see big shapes, bright colors," she told him. "Dif‌ferent ones each time. Deep blue spirals. Orange pinwheels.
        Fields of yellow f‌lowers."

        "Hippie chick," he marveled.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Sister Emily">
        <prolepsis>Harley struggled up to a sitting posture, locking his hands behind the small of her back, holding her to him, her legs
        wrapped tight around his hips. "Do you know, my sister Emily's never had it."

        He was tracing curves and circles below her shoulderblades. "Had what?"

        "You know. The big O."

        It was getting very hard for Harley to pay attention to this conversation, primarily because this wasn't the only thing
        getting very hard. "You're kidding."

        She shook her head. "Claims it's too scary for her."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Scary Indeed">
        <prolepsis>"Scary?" Harley wondered, momentarily driven from distraction.

        "Yeah. You know how I see shapes and colors when it happens to me? Well, Emily says she sees her own body.
        As if she's outside of it. As if she's dead."

        Harley considered. "I thought you said she's never —"

        "She hasn't. That's just on the way."

        "Scary indeed."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Tell Me">
        "I can't do it," Victor protested.

        Jude straddled him, hiking the loose skirt far up her thighs. He could feel her mons against the crotch of his jeans.
        He could feel the heat of her. And now she was leaning over, covering him, kissing lightly along his jaw and around
        his lips. The tips of her breasts grazed his chest.

        "Tell me how her skin smelled."

        "Jude."

        "Tell me." She unbuttoned her dress to the waist and slipped it of‌f her shoulders, pulling her arms free. She ran a
        white nail around the aureole of her left breast. The nipple stood out, dark and f‌irm. He felt a little shiver run
        through her thighs.
    </div>

    <div title="Scent">
        <prolepsis>She bent down to cover him again, stroking the hair back from his temples, holding her hips away from him as he
        caressed her sides, touched the nape of her neck, kissed her strong chin.

        "Remember," she insisted. "Remember her scent. What was it like?"

        Victor held her to him, feeling the rush as her bare breast met his own. His body woke up. He felt his cock grow
        heavy with need, slick with anticipation, though he knew he wasn't quite hard. The erection held off, sensing
        doubts.

        "Sweat," he said, bringing his hand down along her taut back to the lowest notch of her spine. "She never used
        deodorant or perfume. She smelled like sweat."

        "And you liked that."

        "I loved it."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Fetish">
        <prolepsis>Jude squared her shoulders and smoothed her short black hair. She hugged her elbows and shifted her hips ever so
        slightly forward. Just enough. Shutting her eyes, she moved herself gently against him.

        She was feeling desire on an unknown scale, desire so deep and compelling it made her quiver. She wanted what the
        body wants, to touch and be touched, but that was only the beginning. In the give and take of bodies she wanted
        to reach what was in his mind, to trace out the past for which he mourned and inscribe it on her own present.

        Like all great desires this one was neither plain nor simple, it was radically perverse. The perversity was what set
        Jude's thighs trembling and brought on the wetness inside her. Tonight's desire was a kind of fetishism, as deeply
        symbolic as it was sexual. She wanted to join with both of them,. he who was with her and she who wasn't, the
        present and the represented. She was trying to create a link that would unite all three of them, a symbolic link
        outside of bodies and time.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Double">
        <prolepsis>So everything she did that night came in twos, superimposed. She felt a doubled presence — her own body here
        and now with its needs and desires, and the body of the other, lost in the past, retained only in story and memory.
        She felt doubled motives — every touch both a passionate overture and a deliberate deception.

        There was doubleness even in her feelings for Victor — she loved him as the best of friends, she felt a deep
        sympathy, but on some level she resented his self‌ish obsession. He wasn't the only one with longings that couldn't
        be satisf‌ied. She needed somehow to show him this tonight. She wanted to bring him pleasure; she wanted to give
        him pain.

        She was looking to do both at once.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Unexpected">
        <prolepsis>Jude got up from the bed and stepped out of her dress and panties, kneeling to help Victor off with his jeans. He
        started to peel down his underwear but she stopped him, wanting to do that herself. His breath caught when she
        bared his cock, a big teardrop of desire shining at the tip. She took a step back and crossed her arms, deciding all of
        a sudden to tease.

        Jude watched him watching her, his penis thick and stirring. He 1ooked at her in anticipation. If she was serious
        about taking him back to the past, she'd know what came next.

        And in fact Jude knew exactly what he wanted. It was easy enough — she only had to think what the other woman
        would have thought, where she found her pleasures, how she would have made love to this man. Jude knew what
        he wanted. She felt herself go warm at the thought. But she had her own agenda.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Mirror">
        <prolepsis>Jude stepped away from the bed, crossing over to a walk-in closet on the other side of the room. She opened the
        door a crack and slipped inside. "Where are you going?" he asked. "Do we need —"

        "No, I've got some in my bag."

        He rolled over onto his side. "So what are you doing?"

        Jude swung the door open and stepped out, watching the surprise cross his features. Two separate stages of
        surprise, in fact, a double take. The f‌irst came when he saw her face framed not by the usual jet black razor cut, but
        instead by a long pale blonde cascade. The second came right after this, when she turned to show him the mirror.

        "I hope you don't mind," she said, craning back to see how the hair lay along her neck. It was an old cheval glass,
        tilted to ref‌lect the bed and all in it. "Sometimes I watch."</prolepsis>

        "I think Borges was an intellectual masturbator." Jude proposed.

        "Er," Macarthur objected with a glance at Amanda. "Maybe you shouldn't put it that way in front of the child."
        Amanda shot him a really dirty look. "Speak for yourself, buddy, I may only be f‌ifteen and a half but I do have two
        advanced degrees in Electrical Engineering and I know things about masturbation that are beyond your dampest
        dreams."

        Macarthur shook his head. "Grad school sure has changed in the year and a half since I was there."

        "Fork you," Victor muttered.
    </div>

    <div title="Correct Yourself">
        <prolepsis>"Borges was worse than a masturbator," Jude carried on. "Intellectually speaking this guy just couldn't get it up."

        This remark got an immediate rise out of Victor. "Hey," he protested, "how about we lose the phallic-aggressive
        sexist language, okay?"

        "Oooh!" Jude and Amanda cried out together. "Pee CEE!" They turned in their seats for a quick high-f‌ive.

        "Women," Victor fumed.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="About Time">
        <prolepsis>Victor tossed his book on the table. "Come on, Macarthur, you explain it if you can. Why are we reading this stuff?
        What possible relevance does some dead Argentine's twisted joke of a murder mystery have to Virtual Reality?"

        "Well," Macarthur replied, "it's about time."

        ”About time we started getting past this bullshit."

        "What he means," Amanda interposed, "is that the story claims to contain a riddle whose answer is 'time.'"

        "I hate riddles."

        "Oh well," Macarthur said, looking at his watch, "I'm not real fond of time."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="With Mirrors">
        <prolepsis>"The trouble is," Jude Busch noted, "what that story has to say about time is really a lot of horseshit. Time is a
        garden of possibilities, some kind of cosmic combinatorial, a universal lottery." She reached over and poked Victor
        in the ribs. "I can see how that connects to VR, even if some of us are too slow."

        "Time becomes the matrix of all simulations," Amanda put in, her prodigiousness showing.

        "Just so," Macarthur encouraged.

        "So what?" Victor tossed back.

        "Right, what's the point?" Jude said. "Simulation is one thing, real experience is another. Borges knew that. If you
        ask me he wrote that story as a parlor game. If that's 'magic realism,' then it's the sort of magic you do with mirrors."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Mirrors on the Ceiling">
        <prolepsis>"Mirrors and copulation," Amanda lamented. "I mean, please."

        "Did you guys skip ahead to the Sade reading," Macarthur wondered. "or am I missing something in this text?"

        "Borges was a pervert wanker," Jude accused. "He liked to watch."

        "How's that?" Macarthur wondered, seriously perplexed by now. It occurred to him that sitting in on this seminar
        was not exactly <analepsis>the small favor Urquhart said it would be.</analepsis>

        "Or maybe he didn't," Amanda amended. Seeing Macarthur was in real dif‌ficulties, she decided to make an extra
        ef‌fort. "It's in that Orbis Tertius story," she explained. "Borges has this dude say that mirrors and copulation are
        abominable because both increase the number of men. How could it get any plainer?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Plain Enough">
        <prolepsis>"The Garden of Forking Paths is pure fantasy," Jude concluded. "It has nothing to do with history or human
        experience. It's all a nice, self-contained game. Like your VR."

        Macarthur stared. "You don't think you're taking kind of a narrow view... ?"

        "We're linear animals. We're born; we live; we die. That's pretty much inescapable. We make choices, we take the
        consequences. As for your hypertexts and multiple simulations, well how nice for you. But what do they mean in
        the real world?"

        "A world with real problems," Amanda reminded.

        "A world that's about to have another war," Victor put in.

        "Hardly seems a good time to be running away into fantasy," Jude pointed out.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Work">
        <prolepsis>"No, wait," Macarthur maintained, "you're not getting it. We're talking about possibilities and alternatives. Try for a
        minute to see beyond necessity, beyond determinism. Who says there's only one way? Who says it only happens
        once? If we use our imaginations we can learn to see the world differently, and with that vision we can create
        systems that aren't constrained to singularity. Multiple values, multiple horizons. That's what the shift to virtuality
        is all about — to create new worlds that make room for difference. Why, some day we might even be able to bend
        time itself."

        There was a long, somewhat laden silence in which everybody kept looking toward the door.

        "All's I can say is," Amanda summarized as gently as she could, "just you try to build something that way and have
        it work."

        "I need a drink," Victor Gardner announced, and with that they adjourned.</prolepsis>

    <div title="Otherworldly">
        Lights and screens blinked on spasmodically in houses all along the empty streets, his own included; the world was
        plugging in. Urquhart didn't see the need.

        He stood in the scrub, down in this pocket of quiet darkness banked on all sides by the spreading radiance. He felt
        as if he'd just turned on some sharp vector, bearing into a kind of adjacency, another world. Back there was the
        History of the West with all its glare and anxiety, the long struggle for deferral under a sinking sun. Here was
        somewhere dark, dumb and solitary, a still point outside the babble and flow. If he ignored it, if he tried to be
        Outside, maybe it would all go away.

        Maybe he could be at peace.

        Better question, though | how can you be OUT of this situation? Is that why
        you're not writing, Thea? Is it because you think this is a diffrent place
        somehow, one that doesn't plug into Sweet Home Tara? Have I fallen off the

        Think again, dearie. This ain't no alien planet, tho I admit it sometimes

        You never know. We've got a lieutenant here who's an astrophysicist back in

        Leroy got up to walk off some frustration. His long limbs seemed too big for his body, too big for the close room. "I
        know where I come from," he said quietly. "I'm not forgetting."

        "Don't."

        "Hey," Leroy protested, "I just spent three weeks hitching all over the country. I did thirty-f‌ive hundred miles on a
        hundred bucks and the old f‌ive-f‌inger discount, plus what I could hustle in pills along the way."

        Thea put her head back and fought of‌f the urge to shriek. "This makes me so happy, Roy. Any outstanding
        warrants? Any bikers on your trail? Contracts on your life?"

        "Nope, I'm squeaky-clean." He grirmed a brittle grin. "Like father, like son."

        didn't have much use for the rules when I was your age. I'll even admit that you have a right to do the same —
        though get this straight, you're the one who takes the consequences if the shit comes down."

        He nodded; that much was understood.

        "Just remember, I thought I was breaking the rules for a good reason. I didn't like the way they were driving the bus,
        so every now and then I let some air out of the tires. I wasn't always right but I had commitments, I thought my

        unregenerate worst; the trick was in telling them apart. The mood was running high even though one of the titular
        hostesses had just trooped of‌f to the oilf‌ields to defend our western way of life. Most folks were able to take this in
        stride. It took a lot to slow down a Runbird party.

        "Oh wow, Hugo's got some Ex," cried a woman in a slashed black leotard.

        "Ex," said her companion, the guy in the gold lame jockstrap and matching sandals. "Oh wow, I haven't had any of

        in the liting room showing Thea Agnew all about body shots.

        "Like in, ah, pro wrestling?" Thea wanted to know.

        "Nope," Jude explained, "like in tequila with salt. Here," she offered to demonstrate, slipping Thea's Clash T—shirt
        over the curve of one pale shoulder. She applied a liberal coating of salt f‌lakes. "First a little of this," sending a f‌irm

    <div title="Big Story">
        It was a great relief to be back in History again after so many decades of cold-war stasis, all those years spent
        Waiting for the End of the World. We were taught to expect holocaust but in the end (as usual) History surprised
        us. No one can name the exact occasion — Nixon's dinner in Peking, the fall of Saigon, Brezhnev's death, the demise
        of the Shah, Reagan's re-election, the night the Berlin Wall came down — but somehow the old world did f‌ind an
        end to its misery, and so we reach millenium's end looking down the tunnel at a New World Order.

        No one knows what that really means. Mister Bush sings novus ordo saeculorum, thinking whoo-whoo! now
        returning on Track 91, the delayed American Century. But he is wrong. History is not about return or repetition.
        You can't get back to the future.

        History, the big story, is about the possibility of rapid and fundamental change.

        all work to all play, a deadly game.

        Congratulations Mister Macarthur you've chosen VERY wisely! It's today's least probable but most coveted
        airline mishap —

        Desertion by the Flight Crew During a Wildcat Pilots' Strike!

        And now here are your captain and first of‌ficer, Winslow Pardee of Lubbock, Texas and Lubbock Winslow of
        Pardee, Texas... they'd just like you to shake their hand before they execute their Daring Leap for Life from the
        rear hatchway! Folks, howbout a round of applause for our captains courageous and a rousing Bronx cheer for
        the man who made today's horror necessary — Mister Kenneth Q. Macarthur of 397-99 Park Slope Avenue in
        Brooklyn, New York!

        You realize that everyone aboard the beast is staring at you.

        When you were in grade school goof‌ing off during Social Studies you read under cover of your desk a story called
        "Kid At The Stick." This ten-year-old has to take the controls of Grandad's Piper Cub when the old guy gets a
        coronary at 15,000 feet. Kid brings ship in for adequate landing with the assistance of God and his Dog and they
        give him a medal and tell him about death.

        You should have paid attention in Social Studies. Then you might not have read that story, and you might not
        therefore be having this particular terror-dream tonight, though you never listen and it could have been worse. The
        other story you remember from grade school is "The Strange Death of Louis Slotin." Don't worry, we'll save that one
        for later.

        Anyway here you are being hustled by the wailing passengerate toward the maw of the hurtling Beast. You know
        now that you are utterly and completely inadequate.

        In a really good dream anything is possible.

        But really good dreams are statistically unlikely unless your biorhythm is up around 0.82 and you just had a quick
        look at the starboard biometer which reads 0.29 and falling. Uh oh.

        So you settle down in the Command Couch, admiring its rich corinthian leather, and take a glance at the whistles and
        bells. High above you Navy submariners in crepe soles prowl the catwalks calmly logging anomalies in the RCS.
        Nearer at hand your therapist wants to know why your dreams always involve being in control of things. You dial
        down his rheostat until he is the size of an annoying bug. "Can you really f‌ly this thing, Guido?" an anxious f‌light
        attendant asks. "Sure," you lie shamelessly. You can tell that this Beast is equipped with the new f‌ly-by-wire, but
        since it has evidently slipped off the wires there is nothing for it but to use the backup, which seems to be an
        IBM-AT with 1200-baud modem.

        "I thought you had to get back to Vegas tonight," Urquhart pointed out.

        There was a momentary delay until Macarthur got to a carriage return. "I'm booked on America's Worst at 9:45, but
        given the circumstances I think I'll drive."

        Urquhart considered. "It's at least twenty hours point-to-point."

        Macarthur went on tapping away, peering up for a second as Walter Cronkite came on one of the screens. "True,"
        he allowed f‌inally, "but you're not at the mercy of the planes."
    </div>

    <div title="The Planes">
        <prolepsis>Macarthur always referred to any aspect of air travel as The Planes. Many people found this odd, though Urquhart
        wasn't one of them. <analepsis>He'd spent his boyhood living under the glide path of an airport that once had the resonant
        name of Friendship. Folks in his neighborhood said The Planes all the time, meaning those great noisy presences
        always overhead. Since many of the local jobs were in radar and avionics, they were referred to with affection and
        even reverence. They were f‌lying temples of the god Technology, moving symbols of the national will, reminders of
        our passage.</analepsis>

        But when Macarthur said The Planes, you were meant to recognize it as the title of a f‌ilm, to wit the world's
        longest-running horror movie. Get him started on the subject and he'd sooner or later deliver his Hannah Arendt
        shtick: "Banality of evil? Just check out a crash scene sometime..."

        Urquhart actually like f‌lying. To him The Planes were fascinating, beautiful. But then he'd never seen one in pieces</prolepsis>.
    </div>

    <div title="Disasterman">
        <analepsis>Miles Macarthur made his f‌irst appearance in The Planes at four a.m. in a Long Island potato f‌ield in 1973.

        Owing to a chain of terrible blunders, a 727 had lost power while circling fogbound LaGuardia. It was a classic
        crash-and-burn. Macarthur, would-be wirephoto man, caught the emergency call on his police scanner, grabbed his
        Leica and flashgun and flew out the door. He was on the scene in eighteen minutes.

        Macarthur scaled a fence, slipped past the volunteer f‌ire company, and ran right up to the broken fuselage before
        the smell put him down. It wasn't the smoke or the kerosene fumes, it wasn't the toxic boilout from the plastic interior
        or the stink of burned f‌lesh — it was the umistakable reek of spilled blood.

        He got sick, he got his pictures, he went home, but he was never the same. He'd had his f‌irst tryst with Madame

        Miles would not be f‌lying tonight, nor for many months to come. He too could feel the furious logic, the continuum
        of violence. <analepsis>293 dead on the ground at Lockerbie</analepsis> equals 18 kilotons of conventional explosives FOC Baghdad
        equals X. The value of X to be specif‌ied at a much later date, long after the shooting was over, just as our memories

        He would take his chances on the road. He had enough bad dreams.

    <div title="Mail">
        Moving farther along in the scrub, Urquhart thought about things dispatched: mail, messages, missives, missiles.

        Emily was an M.A. in cultural anthropology trained as a Spanish language specialist, so of course the Army stuck
        her in the Quartermaster Corps sorting letters. Something like a quarter-million pieces in a typical week.

        Things dispatched, point-to-point, medium-range, long distance. News and heartfelt wishes, love and cookies.
        What were the two things Schwarzkopf always asked them? — how's the chow soldier, you gettin' mail reglar, that's
        nice. Victory through information.

        How bad would it get?
    </div>

    <div title="No Genius">
        Boris. He improves with distance I guess. I really do miss him these days
        &amp; that's not just me hormoaning. How long have we been together anyway |
        must be nearly three years. You should know, <analepsis>you were the one introduced us</analepsis>
        (its all your fault).

        <analepsis>At first I thought he was a genius,</analepsis> you know, or OK maybe you don't know and
        it sounds silly. So I'm silly. I admit it, <analepsis>I thought he was fucking
        brilliant (not to mention a brilliant fuck). I was actually scared to talk
        to him.

        Anyway after a hundred years or so it finally dawned on me that this wasn't
        genius after all. Was it the day I discovered he never balanced his
        checkbook, just opened a new bank account when it got too screwed up? Or
        the time we got lost going up to Santa Fe and after half a day driving in
        circles I see what map he's reading and it's South Dakota.</analepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Paranoid">
        Let's face it, if Boris ever wins a Nobel (which he can't since they're not
        ever likely to give one for Artificial Realty) it'll be thru some kind of
        bizarre accident. <analepsis>That amazing work he's supposed to have done back in the
        eighties,</analepsis> he tells me himself <analepsis>it was a blunder. He erased a chunk of code
        once without realizing it and when the remaining bits got back together all
        kinds of strange shit happened and the Pentagon creamed its jeans.</analepsis>

        Turns out the man isn't brilliant after all. The man is simply crazy. He's
        come to believe in his own luck, which of course he figures is part of some
        Cosmic Conspiracy or other. The world's worst true believer, 100% paranoid.
        The thing is, now that there's no more genius to contend with, I'm finding
        that I really love the lunatic. What is this I ask you, some kind of wierd
        co—dependency thing, Women Who Love Men Who're Right Round the Bend? Am I
        ready for Donahue yet? Or is he contagious maybe | am I finally as loony as
        he is?

        Is that a paranoid question?
    </div>

    <div title="Polaroid">
        The thing is, Thea, strange as his behavior always is, lately he seems to be
        slipping over the edge even by his own standards. I mean, what am I
        supposed to make of this Polaroid he sends me with him standing in front of
        the freaking Iraqi flag? Dressed up in these designer desert fatigues with
        a revolver stuck in his web belt. And holding, of all things, some kind of
        old carbine.

        You know the guy <analepsis>(and have for a lot longer than I have).</analepsis> It's some kind of
        political statement, I know. I suspect he's not real happy about my being
        here. Ho ho, very funny Boris.

        Anyway, I'd appreciate if, if its not too much trouble, if you could
        reassure me about his sanity, or else maybe get him set up in some nice
        institution. Gotta be one that allows conjugal visits, that's all I ask.
    </div>

    <div title="More To It">
        In fact there's more to this whole Boris thing, boss. More than you
        probably even suspect. <analepsis>My life's gotten real complicated lately.</analepsis> More
        complicated than I want really.

        I dont think this is the right place to be telling you about it, so I'll
        leave it at that. But I'd like to have a good long talk with you some time |
        That's assuming you'll still TALK to me when I get back! Come on, boss,
        send us a line or two, will ya?

        This Information Kiosk looks kind of odd because it's wearing a dark suit and a yarmulke. But then again it also
        looks familiar, in fact it looks a lot like Rabbi Berman who used to live down the street from you in Park Slope.
        You used to talk with him all the time about metaphysics and the theology of airplane crashes.

        The Kiosk smiles because it sees that you remember.

        — Once upon a time, it says in its synthesized voice, somebody told me a story. But this is not that story, this is
        another one. It is called "The Rabbi's Gift." Think Return if you'd like to hear it, or think No to cancel.
    </div>

    <div title="Monastic">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Once there was a great monastery deep in a European forest. This monastery was once a center of faith, learning,
        and spirituality. But as the world moved f‌urther f‌rom God, the monastery fell on hard times. A11 its branch houses
        were seized by the State and in the mother house only four monks remained, the old Abbot and three brothers, all
        over seventy.

        It happened that this monastery lay in a forest not far from a little hut that a rabbi used as a hermitage. From
        years of fasting and prayer the monks had developed a kind of second sight, so that they knew when the rabbi
        came to his hut.

        They would pause in their work or observances and say to each other, "The rabbi is in the woods again."
    </div>

    <div title="Ecumenical">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        This is a nice story isn't it, says your friend the Kiosk.

        One day the Abbot became consumed with grief at the thought that his order would soon perish. It happened that
        the rabbi was in his hut this day, and so the Abbot decided to visit this holy man and ask him if the could f‌ind a
        remedy for their terrible predicament.

        The rabbi greeted the Abbot and they prayed and read Scripture together. When the Abbot told his troubles, the
        rabbi listened with sympathy but could offer little comfort. "It's just the same in my town," the rabbi lamented,
        "everywhere the people reject the life of the spirit." So they wept together and prayed and at last the Abbot rose
        to go. On the threshold he paused and asked once more if the rabbi had no good counsel for him.

        "I'm sorry," the rabbi said. "I can tell you only this: that the Messiah is one of you."
    </div>

    <div title="Inspirational">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        The Abbot thanked him and returned to the monastery, where he meditated long and hard on what the rabbi had
        told him. That night the brothers came and asked if there was any good news from the rabbi. The Abbot answered
        no, that the rabbi had been able to offer only a cryptic prophecy.

        So the monks returned to their life of contemplation, but the rabbi's words did not leave them. Suppose, each of
        them thought, the rabbi meant that the Messiah is not merely a Christian, but one of us here at the monastery?
        But if that is the case, which of us did he mean? Father Abbot? Brother Alaric, Brother Hugo? Or Brother
        Costello?

        And it was at this point, the Kiosk continues, that the rabbi's gift manifested itself to the monks. Suspecting that
        one of them might be the Son of God, the monks begin to treat each other with love and reverence. So striking was
        their transformation that worldly people began to f‌lock again to the monastery. Eventually young men asked to
        join the aging monks and the order was saved f‌rom extinction.
    </div>

    <div title="Supplementary">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        — You liked that story very much, didn't you? says the Kiosk, smiling and folding its simulated hands.

        — It was, um, very uplifting, you say, wiping away a little tear.

        There is a quick pause while the Kiosk does a few million fast Fouriers, peering earnestly at your face.

        — You'd like to hear more, wouldn't you?

    <div title="Diabolic">
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Every time I hear this story, the Kiosk says, whether it's told by a rabbi, a priest, a minister, or a doctor of
        philosophy, it comes out with the same happy ending. The spirit returns, the monks are saved. How inspiring, how
        full of hope.

        How sad and unreal.

        Because I know what I'm talking about — I've been to those deep woods. I've seen the weathered scraps of the
        rabbi's hut and the broken walls of the old monastery. And that's not all I've seen.

        Buried in the old kitchen midden I found the skeletons of three old men, each showing the same distinctive marks.
        The ribcages had been pierced, the wrists and ankles shattered.

        Flashing the light in his eyes, on again then off, such a neat little parlor trick really though it does tend to aggravate

        business. The Reverend Graham exchanged one-liners with Burns about making preparations for Eternity.
        Although the Bible makes no mention of it, the Reverend Graham assured the audience that God loves those who
        make people laugh.

        Madden made the most of available light: he always saw what he could see. It was a professional ref‌lex, a skill of his
        trade. When someone turned on a table lamp in a distant window or, as in this case, drove by with his map light on,
        Madden noticed. Which was how Madden came to spot Erich K. Heidel driving in some haste out of the
        observatory parking lot just as he pulled his own car into the drive, right on time for his 8:00 meet with Tate.

        It was also part of the ref‌lex to be curious about what the light revealed to you, especially when that revelation
        pointed toward some coincidence or pattern. Madden had no idea what Heidel would want with Tate. Were there
        more moves afoot to crush the Politically Correct? Or was it correctness that Heidel wanted — Madden could never
        keep it straight. He did however recognize the basic signif‌icance of the event: Heidel's being here at this of all
        moments meant that he was a player, a man with access to power. What game Heidel was playing Madden could
        only guess. His business tonight was with Tate.
    </div>

    <div title="Stargazing">
        <prolepsis>Madden blinked up into the semi-darkness. "Hello?" Tate sat in the cage, looking and thinking, oblivious.

        <analepsis>Constructed in the forties,</analepsis> this old telescope was a museum piece, the quality of its 180-inch mirror long ago of‌fset
        by the antiquity of its mechanism and light pollution from the growing city. The University's main research facility
        lay a hundred and f‌ifty miles away across the prairie, far from the glare of the urban belt.

        Even that newer instrument was falling into neglect these days, with most of the University's astronomers frantically
        trying to retrieve scientif‌ic salvage from the Hubble disaster. No one was doing much old-fashioned stargazing.
        The old observatory drew only a few dozen students on most days, and these lately not from Astronomy but from
        the new History of Science program.

        Most nights, like tonight, Tate had the place all to himself.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Class Trip">
        <prolepsis>Madden looked around himself at the dusty old ironwork, the massive hydraulic tubes, the cables and pulleys and
        junction boxes. A memory f‌loated up from <analepsis>very far in his past, the sixth or seventh grade of elementary school,
        when Madden's class had gone to visit the observatory at a local college.</analepsis>

        Madden pictured in his mind <analepsis>the man in the observer's perch there — it was called a "viewing cage,"</analepsis> he remembered.
        It wasn't his face he remembered so much as <analepsis>his manner, the way he'd held his concentration unbroken even as his
        workplace f‌illed with loud and obstreperous twelve-year-olds.</analepsis>

        Madden remembered <analepsis>staring at the man, wondering if he was drunk or asleep. He never even looked at them.</analepsis></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Inside Tate">
        <prolepsis>Looking up at Tate in the cage now, Madden tried to keep that old memory from coloring his present impressions.
        Tate did seem just as abstracted, just as high-in-the-sky as <analepsis>that old man back in Wisconsin.</analepsis> But it would be a
        mistake, he reminded himself, to think that Tate's feet were anywhere but f‌irmly on the ground.

        This was Stephen A. Tate, former Presidential advisor on technology assessment, ex of NASA and NACA and
        before that the Off‌ice of Strategic Services. This was Tate the insider, Tate the old Washington hand — Tate, some
        said, who'd been shadow manager of Operation Paperclip. Tate was no faraway academic, no ordinary stargazer.

        "Special Agent Madden, is it?" Tate asked when he was good and ready.

        "Do you want me to come up there?"

        Tate laughed. "If you can manage it. I think you'll f‌ind it worth the effort."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Quiz">
        <prolepsis>Madden hauled himself up the steel gangway, trying to go easy in the poor light.

        "What do you know about scales of astronomical measurement, Agent Madden?" Tate called down to him.

        "Real big numbers," he said. "They're what you folks around here use for real estate deals." He paused to catch his
        breath. "And bank failures."

        Tate tapped some medium-sized numbers into a keypad. "But I mean 'astronomical' in its literal sense. For instance,
        do you have any idea of the ratio between the orbital areas of the earth and the moon?"

        Madden made it to the viewing cage only a little the worse for wear. He dug out his wallet and presented his
        credentials. "You'll have to make that one easier, Prof — I'm afraid I slept through everything af‌ter plane geometry."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Plane Geometry">
        <prolepsis>Tate smiled, cross-checking the badge against its bearer. "That's all I'm talking about, plane geometry." He picked
        up a portable whiteboard from a jumble of books and papers, slipped a marking pen from his pocket and drew two
        large circles.

        "Our general neighborhood," he said, "the orbit of our planet around the sun." Tangent to this circle he drew a
        second circle, more of a fat dot really. as tight as the pen point would allow. "Call that the orbit of the moon around
        the earth. This drawing is grossly distorted but it should give some sense of the scale."

        "Okay." Madden was more or less amused by this unexpected astronomy lesson. Why not? Unlike most people, he
        had no desire to go home and wallow in the war news; and the business end of tonight's conversation wouldn't be
        much fun-. If Tate wanted to play Carl Sagan, let him go ahead. "So what's this all mean?" Madden asked.

        Tate tapped the whiteboard. "Probability and coincidence," he replied.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Cometary">
        <prolepsis>"Probability of what?" Madden asked him.

        Tate drew a series of parabolic curves on the whiteboard, their legs bisecting the earth's orbital circle at various
        points. Madden looked at them and something in his old school memories clicked.

        "Comets?" he said. "You're working on the probability of a comet passing close to the earth. What, have you got
        some dinosaur theory or something?"

        Tate considered his drawing critically as if it still lacked something. "Not comets," he explained. "Not dinosaurs.
        Something much more interesting."

        "Like what?"

        Tate gestured toward the eyepiece of the telescope, inviting him to look.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Plane">
        <prolepsis>Madden sat down in the viewer's chair and put his head to the eyepiece. There was a considerable scrunch
        involved because he had a good f‌ive inches on Tate. At f‌irst he couldn't see much of anything. Tate got up
        apologetically and made some f‌ine adjustments.

        "There may be billions of cometary bodies out in the Oort cloud," Tate told him, "yet close approaches to the earth
        are rare. This is because most comets come in on angles quite oblique to the ecliptic, the plane in which the
        planetary orbits lie."

        Madden f‌inally got the eyepiece f‌igured out, drawing on <analepsis>his long experience with binoculars and other peeping
        devices.</analepsis> He saw what he could see.

        "It is highly unlikely that a comet or other fast moving object would approach in the plane of the ecliptic," Tate
        continued. "But look there."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="What He Could See">
        <prolepsis>What Madden could see wasn't much — a point of light, not very bright really, against a black f‌ield. There may
        have been some shadowy mass around the bright point, or it might just have been Madden's blurred vision. His
        eyes weren't what they'd once been.

        "This thing is in the plane of the ecliptic?" Madden surmised.

        "That's right. Moving on a parabolic trajectory that will carry it around, or more likely into, the sun."

        "Sounds like a comet to me. Maybe a rare one."

        "It could be. Though from the way it looks, it's more likely an asteroid."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Perigee">
        <prolepsis>Madden looked up. "Asteroids drop in all the time, don't they? That's where meteor showers come from."

        "Hm," said Tate. "But consider. The object you're presently viewing, at relatively low magnif‌ication I might add,
        measures more than half a kilometer across. If it came down, it would not be one of your ordinary meteors."

        "Are you saying it's time for some disaster insurance?"

        Tate laughed again. "No, we're quite safe. Tracking data give a perigee somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000
        miles."

        Madden tried to remember a few basic astronomical facts, like the distance between the earth and the moon. Around
        a quarter—million miles, he thought. "That's kind of close."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Patterns">
        <prolepsis>"It's more than close," said Tate. "It's downright weird."

        "What do you mean?"

        Tate tapped the whiteboard again. "Even given that this object is approaching in the plane of the ecliptic, consider
        the probability of its intersecting the earth's orbit just here." He pointed to a spot slightly off center on the smaller
        circle, the one that stood for the orbit of the moon. "The chances of an asteroid just happening to thread the gap
        between the earth and the moon are, shall we say, astronomically small."

        Madden thought about it. "Enough to give you the creeps," he allowed.

        Tate contemplated his diagram, a fat circle overwritten by a tangle of bent lines. It looked like something out of a
        medical book — a web of capillaries on the corneal wall, a tangle of neurons in some ganglion, an egg beset by
        wiggling sperms.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Coinicidence">
        <prolepsis>"Highly improbable, that's for sure." He set the whiteboard up against a pile of books. "But now let's add in another
        set of variables. Variables of a different order, not astronomic or physical at all. Let's call these variables 'historic.'"

        "Eh?"

        Tate opened his hands, palms up. "History, Agent Madden. Human af‌fairs. The struggles of nations. What do
        you suppose the odds are of such a rare astronomical event happening just as the industrialized world enters its
        most signif‌icant military conf‌lict since the Second World War?"

        As would most of us, Madden immediately heard music: the four-note signature of The Twilight Zone theme, cycling
        over and over in his head. He knew <analepsis>the spy business had had its share of eccentrics in the old days,</analepsis> but Tate was
        something special. Not wishing to show disrepect, he kept these thoughts to himself. "Coincidence," he said.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="-Emily-">
        <prolepsis>He'll wake in a few hours,</prolepsis> <analepsis>as he has so often these last weeks,</analepsis> <prolepsis>lying above the sheets with his body curled behind
        her. He'll feel her there, her warmth and pulchritude, and he'll want her very, very much.</prolepsis> She might wake up and
        reach for him, they might make love. <analepsis>It's happened.</analepsis>

        Or she may just go on sleeping another half hour or so, till the light in the room is strong enough to rouse her. And
        she'll turn and brush her hair back and pull on her clothes with a heartbreaking briskness and he'll watch her walk out
        the door.

        There's been no talk about it. Every time he tries to speak she covers his mouth with hers.

        Victor.
    </div>

    <div title="Future Tense">
        <prolepsis>He knows full well where this is leading.

        One day he'll come home and Urquhart will be there on the doorstep, most likely in those Inscrutable Shades of his
        and he'll think murder, mayhem, expulsion from candidacy, nasty letters in his dossier, murder at the least.

        But Urquhart will just of‌fer him one of those stupid cigars and he'll light up and the two of them will sit there on the
        front step, watching the sorority girls across the street and wondering what comes next.

        And then Urquhart will say, So you're sleeping with her.

        And he'll say, Yeah that much is obvious.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="A Good Question">
        <prolepsis>Urquhart won't say anything for a while, he'll just sit there smoking. Here it is, Victor will realize, another one of his
        insuf‌ferable Dramatic Pauses.

        Just to prove he can't be so easily manipulated, Victor will go inside and take a pee, make himself a tahini sandwich,
        watch the Weather Channel for a while.

        Then he'll come back out and find Urquhart still there, the only indicator of time being the pile of ash between his
        feet and the relative shortness of his cheroot.

        I'm sleeping with her, Victor will tell him.

        Urquhart will take the cigar and grind it out slowly, with Teutonic precision.

        What do you suppose that means? he'll ask.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="-Victor-">
        Victor's awake when she comes in, sitting up in a pool of lamplight, staring into his terminal. She moves past him
        without a word, goes to the bed and undresses in two or three moves, slides under the covers and settles the pillow
        under her head. He thinks about her body momentarily there for the seeing, thinks of the shape of her limbs and the
        paleness of her skin, the desert tan all but a memory. He thinks but he does not look. He says nothing to her and
        she says nothing to him.

        Sometimes he's already in bed when she comes in. Sometimes he joins her; tonight he doesn't. In a few minutes he
        hears her breathing slow and steady and knows she is asleep.

        Emily.
    </div>

    <div title="...But No">
        As usual in such matters, what happened next was not very clear.

        Billy Van Saxgutter's f‌irst thought was, Aw shoot, he couldn't keep his pants dry after all. Most of the Omega men
        just stood there on the lawn wearing an expression very much like the one you f‌ind on male dogs who come
        slavering after a bitch in heat only to be met by the owner with his garden hose.

        Someone had very thoughtfully switched on Thea's automatic sprinkler system, which because of various
        distractions she had not shut off back in November. Turned up full, the sprinkler jets thoroughly doused the hulk of
        the Rainbow Bus and all who sailed in her, putting out the f‌ire in the roof lining with a loud sizzle.

        Leroy strolled out of the garage, watching the disorderly retreat of the mob. "Oh the Greek life," he observed. "So
        much fun, so many surprises."
    </div>

    <div title="Remember Your Roots">
        "The middle east is only a little bump on the iceberg," Thea pointed out. "There's plenty of other shit to get into if
        you're having too much trouble sorting that one out. There's —"

        "I'll take the short list this time, if you don't mind."

        "Hey, smartass. Maybe I should pull you out of that private school you f‌ind so boring and let you f‌inish up with a
        bunch of nice working-class kids in Tara. You may have grown up a spoiled faculty brat but don't forget who your
        grandparents were. Let's see, there was a plumber, a shipf‌itter, and a factory foreman."

        "Grandpa Sieger was a lawyer."

        "He was a public defender."

        New World Order II: The Evil Empire Strikes Back!

        Just when you thought it was safe to plug back into daytime television... The tank-assault videos rival anything
        from Tienanmen or Manilla (Russia the only nation on earth whose f‌lair for image exceeds our own), but at the
        moment the reports are still sketchy. Seems the Soviet Right (them Communists) have packed Gorbachev off to
        retirement in the Crimea. "The world's last remaining empire," as Dan rather inaccurately describes it, wobbles on the
        brink of civil war. What a year.

        So far it's been a time of wondering what's next. Is it the f‌ire this time, Europe plunged into the blood frenzy some of
        us feared might start in the Gulf? Oris the Great Republican correct when he tells us to chill and get on with our
        vacations? Could it be just a passing convulsion, one more pang of transformation?

        Who can say?
    </div>

    <div title="Balanced Coverage">
        Whatever the outcome, the media men are hot to go, just about falling over themselves with crisis-lust. Oboyoboy
        just when we'd wrung the last nostalgia from that Desert Storm, by golly WE GET TO DO IT AGAIN! And this time
        it's not just a single crisis but TWO AT ONCE! — leave us not forget Hurricane Bob, spinning his llO-mph winds
        and 15-foot storm surges up to the very porches of the Network Nation.

        Dan Rather f‌lashes a quick smile of wry embarrassment and assures daytime America that he's trying to "balance"
        coverage of the Moscow coup against blabber about the Hurricane. Wouldn't want you to become unbalanced in
        your anxieties, would we.

        Yes it's all very stressful, not to mention confusing. "I'm a mother of two at home with the kids," Dan speculates at
        one point.

        Whatever you say, Kenneth.

    <div title="About the War">
        But mainly he's been writing about the War, Veronica went on, the playfulness leaving her voice.

        There was an awkward, expensive silence while the four of us tried to think of something to throw into the gap. <analepsis>The
        War.</analepsis> Strange to think of <analepsis>events barely a year in the past as such a def‌inable event, as a moment in our history.</analepsis> And
        yet, as we well knew, <analepsis>it had changed us all. The War.</analepsis>

        Well, Harley summed up, I just wanted to check in, let you know that we've settled down here f‌or a while. There's

        Y'all be sure and look us up when you come east, right?

        Likewise, vice versa, whatever. Veronica, don't forget to dress warm, sweetie.

    <div title="The Love You Take">
        Jude stared up at the crazy light, thinking it over. The answer wasn't as plain as it might once have seemed.

        <analepsis>She'd wanted something for herself and she'd wanted to prove something to him.</analepsis> Now she wasn't sure what she'd
        proved and she suspected that what she'd got was not quite what she'd desired in the f‌irst place.

        She thought some more, feeling drowsy and a little drunk, until a thought f‌inally came into focus.

        "Did you love Emily?" she asked him.

        "Very, very much," he answered. At which point their last candle went dark.

        "I did too."
    </div>

    <div title="Fishes">
        Jude came back to the bed and lay down with him and they began to make love. She settled in just as he'd expected,
        side by side, six against nine. Jude had known all along. Water babies, sign of the f‌ishes: her emblem, her sign. Not
        a bad sign for Jude either, as it happened.

        At his f‌irst little touch she gasped, her raised leg starting to shake, thinking Oh no this is where I lose it, here's one
        illusion I can't pull of‌f... She ran her f‌ingers down the length of him, felt his hands tighten on her ass as she took him
        into her mouth.

        Tasting his saltiness while she felt him there between her thighs, going on with the patience of true desire, moving
        her, f‌inding his way to her pleasure, until here she was about to lose it again. Oh no. She made hers elfthink of salt
        water, endless oceans, f‌ishes swallowing f‌ishes in the briny deep.

        That didn't work, so she had a look in the mirror.
    </div>

    <div title="The Lovers">
        <prolepsis>She could look into the mirror just by raising her eyes. She saw there the lovers. She saw two pale bodies twined in
        desire. She saw the muscles of his shoulders and neck f‌lexed to hold steady. She saw his arms tight around her
        hips, his right hand pressed along her pubis, his cheek laid on her downward thigh. She saw the way her upraised
        knee was quaking. She saw the long tapering line of his back, the f‌lat place below his waist, the hard curve of his
        ass with its dimpled cheeks. She saw the way his hips pushed up unconsciously as she gave him his pleasure. She
        saw the long thin f‌ingers with their bone-white nails running along his shaft. She saw the blonde head poised there
        over his loins, taking and releasing the length of him. She saw the way his thighs tensed when she ran her tongue
        over the head of his cock, the way his legs opened when she passed a f‌inger around his scrotum. In the mirror she
        saw the two of them making love, the old friends, the impromptu lovers, the tall dark man with the ponytail, the
        slender blonde with all that unruly hair. She saw the bodies twined together, saw them move in compensating
        rhythms, stroke and counterstroke, each desiring the other's desire. And the more she saw, the stranger she felt
        about it.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not There">
        <prolepsis>Suddenly it seemed to Jude that she wasn't really there.

        Even as her last attempt to hold off failed, even as she felt the f‌lush spread over her breast and shoulders and her
        breath began to come in quick spasms, even as she felt the mainspring of her resistance twisted past the breaking
        point, threatening to f‌ling her into violent climax...

        She wasn't there.

        That wasn't her body she saw in the mirror, that wasn't her pale hair spread over her lover's hips. It wasn't her
        smooth thigh trembling in his grasp not her delicate dark-haired mound under his coaxing hand and those weren't
        her own half-closed eyes she looked into as the woman's head suddenly came up lips drawn tight jaw muscles tense
        trying to f‌ight it back —

        No.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Strange Love">
        <prolepsis>Yes folks, love is strange.

        They lay there, Jude and Victor, thigh by thigh, head-to-foot and foot-to-head, joined by the interlaced f‌ingers of
        their right hands. Their pulses were racing and their breath came heavily, beads of sweat lay on their brows,
        especially Jude's under that wig. They were momentarily speechless.

        But don't jump to conclusions. <analepsis>Neither one had officially come, though they'd both been amazingly close, a mere
        synapse-breadth away. Granted, there had been a climax of sorts for both of them. There had even been an
        ejaculation.

        But not the usual kind.</analepsis></prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Strange But Fine">
        <prolepsis>Victor was the f‌irst to catch his breath. "That was her voice," he said.

        "No it wasn't, it was my voice. Her line maybe, but my voice."

        "I'm sorry, but when I heard that, I just couldn't..."

        "It's all right. Neither could I."

        She waited until the throbbing in her head slowed down a bit. "I'm sorry for the way that f‌inished, Victor. Are you
        okay? Do you want—"

        "No," he said, giving her hand a squeeze. "That was f‌ine. Strange but f‌ine."</prolepsis>

    <div title="Don't Ask">
        <prolepsis>It was darker in the black bedroom now; all but one of Jude's candles had gone out. Victor watched the halo from
        the last remaining light dip and f‌lash across the ceiling.

        ”Jude," Victor said after a little more silence.

        "Yes?"

        "Why did we do that?"</prolepsis>

        He nodded into the darkness.

        The problem with the concept of such a new kind of book resides in the preparation of hypertext. What are the
        words and phrases to link, and to what? In turn, what f‌urther connections are expected from the target of such
        links?

        ...Altogether, I think, it is only fair to consider the advent of such publications as doubtful at best.

        The freedom of movement in a hypertext brings with it an excess of narrative possibilities, some of which may lead
        you away from your original destination. The destination may shift dynamically, as other routes, other ports of

        Victory Garden is a hypertext — a story: or a web of stories, whose contours can change every time you read it.

        You move through the text by pressing the Return key to progress from one moment to another, as you would turn
        the pages of a book. Click the right mouse button or strike Backspace to review the previous moment, or to move
        back through the story as you've seen it so far. If you read in this way the story will generally keep within certain
        discrete lines or pathways — though these pathways themselves may shift or change.

        At most moments you can also double-click certain words ("words that yield") which will carry you to a different
        storyline. Though yield-words often create discontinuities, they also map connections.
    </div>

    <div title="Enigma">
        Like any maze or enigma Victory Garden will of‌ten bring you back to a place you've already been. Sometimes these
        familiar moments will be followed by something new. At other times you may f‌ind yourself in a loop, in which case
        you may want to invoke a yield-word. If you choose Show Text Links (by pressing the CTRL key), the words that
        yield will be identif‌ied.

        You can also call up a list of all possible links leading out of a given moment by choosing Browse Links... from the
        Storyspace Menu or pressing the Links button.

    <div title="The Place of Big Wind">
        History, they tell us these days, isn't what it used to be.

        <analepsis>At the time of the last great War, Jorge Luis Borges imagined a f‌iction that would not conform to lines of
        determinism or destiny — a fantastic Chinese novel called The Garden of Forking Paths.</analepsis> Now we f‌ind ourselves
        living once more through world conf‌lict, admittedly of a very different kind from <analepsis>the events of 1914-18 or 1939—45.</analepsis>

        Maybe history is different for us. Perhaps, hypermediated and postmodernized, we now live in a universe that looks
        suspiciously like a Garden of Forking Paths. Or perhaps the old ways of understanding our lives — struggle,
        question, commitment; love, loss, mourning — can't really be pushed aside.

        I didn't set out to resolve that issue. I set out to put some stories in motion, hoping they'd take me somewhere.
        Here's where they led...
    </div>

    <div title="Story of My Life">
        I am trying to get some reading done (story of my life) but the world keeps intruding. It is 7:05 p.m. on the 16th of
        January, 1991. Something dark and terrible is unfolding in Baghdad, Iraq. <analepsis>Something dark and terrible took place in
        Staf‌fordshire, England during the month of July, 1916.</analepsis> Various things, some of them dark and some perhaps terrible,
        are about to happen in a place called Tara. At the moment, none of these events seem real.

        <analepsis>Borges referred to a place called Uqbar, supposedly "a region of Iraq or Asia Minor" which was in fact unreal.</analepsis>
        Uqbar is brought to you by the people who invented Tlon, a conspiracy to replace the bad old world with a novus
        ordo saeculorum. There's a lot of that going around.

        I try to focus on the page or the screen but my mind insists on wandering. I experience that swarming sensation
        again.
    </div>

    <div title="Swarming">
        From that moment on, I felt
        about me and within my dark body an invisible,
        intangible swarming. Not the swarming
        of the divergent, parallel and
        finally
        coalescent armies but a more
        inaccessible, more intimate agitation that they in
        some manner prefigured.

        be postponed until the morning of the 29th. The torrential rains, Captain Liddell Hart comments, caused this
        delay, an insignif‌icant one, to be sure.</analepsis>

    </div>

    <div title="Her Element">
        Veronica reached out toward him and suddenly there were all these people but none of them was Harley and she
        hadn't any idea where he'd gone. She pivoted and twisted, angling her hips and planting her feet deliberately to
        thread the shifting gaps between bodies, feeling her way into the crowd. It was something she did easily and with a
        certain vague pleasure, drawing on instinct. She dodged and wove, circling round and around again but still she
        came up empty. There was no sign of him anywhere in the room.

        She arrived f‌inally at the bar, sliding onto a vacant stool before anyone else could claim it. The TV screen showed a
        sandbox diorama of the Gulf. The camera was panning in slowly toward Baghdad, as if from low earth orbit.

        "I still don't fucking believe this," she found herself saying.
    </div>

    <div title="Compulsion">
        This time the feeling of unreality took root and grew and Veronica felt herself break into a cold sweat.

        For no reason she could think of she kept moving through the crowd, which had come close to some kind of
        equilibrium. It was a strange inspiration, a kind of compulsion to remain in motion while everyone else seemed f‌ixed
        in place. She started to perceive what she was doing as a thing with its own end, like ritual movement or dance.

        She began to look at their faces as she passed them, each one very much the same — slackjawed and turned up to
        receive the news. They moved out of her way inattentively, preserving their lines of sight. She began to stare right
        into their faces. Only a few returned her gaze.

        At last a big man with broad arms and a stiff belly tried to grab her, but he miscalculated her strength and she
        knocked him on his ass.

        Before anyone else could make a move, she grabbed the bar rail and vaulted up, pausing there long enough to plant
        her feet, long enough to let them all blink and shift their focus from the screen to the rude girl in blue jeans who'd
        just jumped onto the bar, the nasty bitch in the silver-toed cowboy boots who was swinging her leg up now,
        pivoting her whole weight through an impossibly high kick, sending her foot smashing right on in dead center
        between Walter Cronkite's patriarchal brows.
    </div>

    <div title="Veronica's Fall">
        <prolepsis>The momentum carried her off her feet and back against the etched mirror behind the bar. The glass cracked and
        buckled and she caromed of‌f, taking a dozen liquor bottles with her to the f‌loor. The crash of it all must have been
        enormous but she was not aware of hearing it.

        When she hit the linoleum she lost her wind and lay there trying to gasp, thinking about screaming charged with
        adrenaline but frozen to the f‌loor. She wondered if she was bleeding.

        Men were moving toward her, a couple of med students and an off-duty cop. As they bent down to examine her she
        got her lungs working again, managed to pull in enough of a breath to wheeze out the thing she wanted to say,
        which she kept repeating when the gurney came and the wheeled her out the door.

    <div title="Aftermath">
        She's given up cigarettes but not whiskey; the spirit of the place hasn't yet done it's worst — she's got a few months
        to go before she hits the Perrier-and-lime barrier. Which is f‌ine with me: we sit out in the chilly evening, listening to
        the ocean and drinking Islay malt, and it may be the end of the world for all I know it, but I feel fine.

        "Heidel resigned," I tell her. "It was in the Chronicle."

        "I saw it."

        Then she'll also have seen where he's going: Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics, a special faculty exchange
        endowed by the Braithwaite Fund. Sharing the Vision. The true West rescues the benighted East from its errors.

        "You know how the song goes," Thea muses. "Tomorrow belongs to me."
    </div>

    <div title="All the Way">
        "If yore gonna get vahlent," Billy Van observed, "yew might's well go all the way."

        With a rising chorus of rebel yells, Billy Van and the Omega boys took up bricks and bats and picket posts and
        commenced beating up on the Rainbow Bus, taking turns whacking and thumping and smashing and tearing away.
        A din of crunched sheet metal and splintering glass rose into the night.

        Ordinarily you'd have expected someone to dial 911 right away, but as <analepsis>Billy Van had earlier pointed out,</analepsis> tonight was
        a special occasion. Though Thea's two nearest neighbors did hear the sounds of destruction, they both assumed it
        must be another CNN report live from Baghdad.
    </div>

    <div title="Where Troubles Melt">
        <prolepsis>The Sigma Omega boys hadn't had this much fun since <analepsis>their last Mexican holiday.</analepsis> Though most of them were pretty
        blase about smashing cars (again?), the act took on new meaning for them when it became part of a violent political
        statement. It was a whole new ballgame. Why, this demonstration stuff was just a pisser.

        Overcome by the joy of demolition, Vance climbed up on the roof of the sacrif‌icial bus, which was — look out —
        about to lose its windshield. He always was something of a showman, that Vance. Finding a somewhat precarious
        balance, he sang out in a surprisingly f‌ine baritone:

        "Some-WHERE oh—ver the rain-BOW!"

        But presently the wrecking crew set the old hulk to rocking so hard that Vance was thrown into the hedge.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Uh Oh...">
        <prolepsis>Now this was where the real trouble started.

        One minute Billy Van Saxgutter was down in the back of the bus having himself a f‌ine old time tearing out handfuls
        of that lef‌tist—liberal upholstery while working on a fresh can of beer. The next thing he knew he was sitting there
        trying to keep his pants dry in the face of certain death.

        It seems somehow the Rainbow Bus had caught f‌ire.

        Billy Van saw smoke seeping out of the headliner a few feet away and tried frantically spraying it with beer foam.
        Without much success. Up on the balcony Thea spotted the f‌irst tongues of f‌lame curling over the roof of the bus.
        She dragged Veronica to the f‌loor with her and started crawling toward the telephone.

        "If that thing goes up we'll all be barbecued."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Marchers">
        "Hey, what's this?" Veronica said.

        It took Thea a moment to realize that she meant something happening outside the window, not on the Tube. She got
        up and joined the other woman at the sliding door, looking down from the balcony at her front lawn.

        "Holy Jesus, it's a demonstration."

        Sure enough, a spare and straggly line of marchers were advancing up the hill toward her house. Carrying signs and
        chanting. Thea edged past Veronica and undid the latch on the sliding door, stepping through to the balcony.

        "Wait a minute," Veronica warned.
    </div>

    <div title="What Do We Want?">
        <prolepsis>"They're chanting something" Thea noticed. "I can't quite hear what it is. Turn off the TV will you?"

        Veronica pulled the plug and came back to join her on the porch. By which time they could both hear very clearly
        what the marchers had to say. A look of growing distress passed between them.

        "Oh shit."

        WHAT DO WE WANT?

        BEER!

        WHEN DO WE WANT IT?

        NOW!</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Messages">
        <prolepsis>"Shove of‌f," Thea called down. "Bar's closed. There's a war on."

        The marchers climbed over the hedge and onto the lawn itself. There looked to be no more than ten of them but they
        were a rowdy crew. Veronica ducked around and hit the f‌loodlights, thinking this might discourage them but it
        seemed to have the opposite effect. The demonstrators began marching in drunken circles around the property,
        waving their pickets and trying to chant some marching song that Thea couldn't identify. It might have been either
        "Born in the U.S.A." or "Sweet Home Alabama" but only a few of the marchers could carry a tune and none could
        agree on a tempo.

        Thea tried to read their signs, which weren't what you'd call highly legible, but she picked up the gist. P.C. NOT
        ME, WE NEED AMERICANS NOT LIBERALS, STOP POLITICAL CASTRATION, SUPPORT OUR TROOPS,
        and of course that old standard, YANKEE GO HOME.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Omega Man">
        <prolepsis>Veronica came back out on the porch looking worried but cool. Thea put an arm around her waist, feeling the
        tension in the muscles of her back. "They're on your lawn," Veronica pointed out. "Want to call the cops?

        Thea shook her head. "They don't look real dangerous and I don't care about the lawn. It's only a bunch of frat
        boys."

        "Yeah maybe." Veronica leaned over as one of the pickets went past. "Yknow," she called down to him, "I've
        always found that Sigma Omega boys have little teensy pricks." She made a very small calipers with thumb and
        foref‌inger.

        "Fuck you bitch!" the marcher yelled back.

        "And brains to match," she added, straightening up. "I thought so."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Joker">
        <prolepsis>Things might not have gone much further had tonight's activity been entirely the work of the Sigma Omega
        f‌raternity. But as we know there was a joker in the deck, or to be accurate, there was one at the wheel of the
        Rainbow Riders' microbus, which after driving around the block for a few minutes in some confusion he f‌inally
        managed to back onto Thea's front lawn. The marchers pulled up short and collected quickly around this new point
        of interest.

        "Holy shit," Veronica said when she saw who was squeezing out of the little cab.

        "Evenin' y'all," Billy Van Saxgutter said, squaring up his string tie and removing his hat. "Does one-a yew ladies
        happen the Perfessor Dor—thea Agnew?"

        "Billy Van," Veronica called out to him. "Be cool for shit's sake."

        The merry prankster squinted up at her. "Izzit that little Runnin' Bird?"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Fancy This">
        <prolepsis>Billy Van crossed his scrawny arms over his chest and slouched against the snub nose of the Rainbow Bus.
        "Howdy there, Little Runbird. Ah didn't know that you and the Perfessor there were, shall we say, close
        acquaintances." Putting on a truly unwholesome leer.

        "Go lick an armadillo," Veronica told him.

        Billy Van tossed in a wink to go with the leer. "No of‌fense Ah'm sure." He resettled his hat on top his big squarish
        head. Thea just stared, beginning to wonder if she didn't prefer television's version of the unreal.

        "What a surprise," Billy Van said to Veronica. "Ah wasn't expectin' t'cross trails with you tonight. But now that Ah
        have, wonder'f you could answer me a little question."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Was That You?">
        <prolepsis>"Eat cactus and die," Veronica suggested.

        Billy Van inspected his left bootheel. "You see, Little Runbird," he related, "Ah was over't the Just Say No a little
        earlier this evenin', and Ah found the place in quite a state. Folks tole me some real strange shit happened jes' before
        I got there."

        "It's a wild town," Veronica reminded him.

        "What Ah heard," Billy Van continued, "was that some f‌illy lookin' very much like yourself went loco in there
        tonight. Just a little ol' gal but she slapped some folks around an' smashed th' ol' place up purty good."

        Thea looked at Veronica and blinked. "Say what?"

        "Would that've happen'd t'be you?" Billy Van wondered.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="What If It Was?">
        <prolepsis>"Suppose it was," Veronica allowed. "What's it to you?"

        Billy Van scratched a f‌loppy earlobe, pondering the implications. "Wahl y'know, Runnin' Bird, Ah al'ays did regard
        you as havin' more cojones than half the so-called bad hombres in this town."

        "I'm touched," Veronica said. "But the SWAT team's overdue. Get to the point."

        The cowboy-agitator pulled himself up and straightened his Lone Star belt buckle. "Perfessor Agnew," he told
        Thea, "me'n the boys here don' exactly approve of yore tryin' t' stomp on Western Civilization an' our Amurkin
        way've lahf. And Ah do confess we come up here tonight t'make a purty emphatic show of our displeasure. But
        owin' to the respect Ah have fer our young friend there, Ah'm gonna advise mah associates t' leave peaceably."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Keep Smiling Until Then">
        <prolepsis>Billy Van tipped his big Stetson gracefully and circled his foref‌inger in the air. "C'mon pards, we can just about make
        last call at the Ramada."

        "Yee ha!" The frat boys scrambled aboard the purloined bus and Billy Van lumbered back into the saddle.

        "'Night now, ladies. Ah expect we'll be meetin' agin." The bus lurched forward, demolishing a four-foot section of
        Thea's hedge, then wallowed out to the street.

        It was at this moment that Leroy showed up, winded and drenched in sweat from his long run up the hill, just in time
        to watch the bandits ride out of Dodge.

        "Happy trails to you," Billy Van called as he turned the bus and smoked off into the Taran night.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Not So Cool">
        "This is not a good time," Veronica warned him.

        Totally oblivious, Billy Van scratched his lef‌t armpit. "Say there, little Runbird. Ah was over to the Just Say No

        "Eat cactus and die," Veronica suggested.

        "Ol' Jeff said thet jes' before Ah got there, a f‌illy lookin' much like yerself got all provoked an' started bumpin' and

    <div title="Object Lesson">
        <prolepsis>Thea decided to add a little input. "What's that to you, pilgrim?"

        Billy Van turned a malevolent eye her way. "Ah was comin' to that," he said, drawing up to his full height and
        straightening his Lone Star belt buckle. "Ah jus' thought that things bein' what they are, y'all might appreciate a
        little object lesson in, uh... political expression."

        He reached a long arm into the microbus and hauled back a large canvas sports bag out of which came a pile of
        bricks and a half dozen metal baseball bats.

        "Now," he continued, kicking the fender of the Rainbow Bus, "this here politically correct hippie faggot vee-hicle,
        we'll just call this our object." He picked up a brick and f‌lung it at a window, scoring a direct hit on a large
        peace-symbol decal. "And that," Billy Van explained, "can be our f‌irst lesson."</prolepsis>

        "From the look on your face you might have been expecting some New Right death squad," Urquhart observed,
        rubbing his leg as she scooted past.

        "Boris, I understand that you're from another planet and I try to compensate, really I do. But look: while picking the
        locks on your colleagues' doors may be something you computer scientists do all the time as a jolly little lark, over
        here in Humanities we still think of it as, oh, I dunno, a criminal of‌fense."

        Urquhart put on his sunglasses. "Try to forgive me."

        "Get f‌ucked. And where'd you get those aviators, jeez, they make you look like —"

        "When did you start smoking?" she wondered.

        He held up a leather cigar case. "Old habit from my Dartmouth days. Cheroots."

        Thea tried to light up but her hand wouldn't stop twitching. Urquhart leaned over to help out. "Lie to me," he said,
        "tell me that's just from too much cof‌fee."

        "I could say it's from my asshole friend breaking into my of‌fice," Thea replied, "but that would be lying too."

        interoff‌ice, newspaper cuttings, a paperclipped copy of Newsweek.

        "I want to cry," Thea said. "No. I want to kill."

        "We've got editorials in both local papers again, a news item in the Atlanta Constitution, and George Will. There's
        also the transcript from Heidel on Larry King."

        "Delightf‌ul."

        Urquhart drew out one of his cigars and got it going. In a few minutes they had the situation nicely clouded.
        Presently the phone rang. Thea picked up the receiver and immediately let it drop. "No calls."

        Urquhart shrugged. "Bad."

        She reached into her shoulder bag and f‌ished out a microcasette recorder, which she slid across the desk toward
        him.

        <prolepsis>Urquhart pressed Play and held the little unit up to his ear. He heard a blip and then the characteristic fuzz of a

        Silence at f‌irst.
        "Excuse me, have I reached Dr. Dorothea Agnew?"

        Veronica stormed onto the porch, letting the screen bang hard in her wake. The air felt strangely warm for the middle
        of October and an early harvest moon threw light on what there was to see. This was, principally, a crowd of
        partygoers and uninvited guests drawn up in a loose semicircle around the derelict Plymouth that somebody had
        parked in their backyard a year ago. A man was standing on the hood of the car, balancing carefully along the
        reinforcing ribs.

        The man was familiar but not in the way Veronica had expected. He didn't look like Boris Urquhart, but rather like
        someone else, someone whose name these days hardly needed repeating. It couldn't be Urquhart. After all, Boris
        didn't wear military berets, jump boots, and one-piece camouf‌lage fatigues, did he? And if he did, he certainly
        wouldn't be sporting gold-braided epaulets, right? And so far as she knew, Boris had never been known to come
        equipped with a sidearm.
    </div>

    <div title="Harangue">
        <prolepsis>Veronica gripped the porch rail and tried to take this in. The man on the Plymouth threw up his arms in a V of
        evocation and started to address the crowd. The crowd, from all appearances, absolutely loved it. She shook her
        head but the tableau did not go away like a well behaved hallucination. She began to make out what the man on the
        car was saying.

        The voice was unmistakably Boris Urquhart's. "The American star is falling," he called. "The mother of all battles
        awaits." Hoots, whistles, cries of encouragement.

        "Tell us more about your mother," a psychiatric intern shouted

        "The west has shaken the east awake," Urquhart continued. "Now see the results. You will walk the paths of terror
        that lead into the garden of vengeance."

        "Say it, say it again!"</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Prophet">
        <prolepsis>"The beginning has ended, the end has begun," Urquhart cried, "Uqbari the prophet has spoken."

        He drew his pistol, pointed it at the moon and squeezed of‌f a quick volley. Veronica held her ears, her head
        spinning. The gunf‌ire sent f‌lat echoes crashing up and down the normally sober street. It was a quiet night for a
        Friday and the sound carried a long way in short order. Already she could hear police sirens winding up, whooping
        higher as they homed in.

        And then all at once Veronica was holding to the rail for dear life as Billy Van Saxgutter blasted out of the house
        brandishing his handy thiry-ought-six and hollering at the top of his great big lungs.

        "GawDAM!" he yelled, "whin'd all th' SHOOT'N start?"</prolepsis>

    <div title="Leroy at the Beach">
        I drive Leroy out to Santos Point. It's not a windsurfer/volleyball beach and the women are more to my taste than
        his, but that's the way I want it today. I want a chance to talk.

        "What's this 'VR' you keep going on about?" I ask him.

        "Virtual reality," he says, "electronically generated interactive environments." He f‌inds a Corona in the cooler and
        an opener in my backpack

        "Like computer games?" I wonder.

        "Gaming's an important part of it," he says, guzzling his beer. "But there are more interesting sides to it. There's
        system sirmulation and interactive training. The Suits all want that because they like to play wargames. I'm more
        interested as an artist."
    </div>

    <div title="New Drugs">
        <prolepsis>"You mean like light paintings, holograms, touch-the-screen video?" I say this knowing I'm probably a decade
        behind him.

        He shakes his head, watching a couple of splendid, big-boned women jogging down by the water. Renee and Thais.
        An interesting choice. They are Parisiennes, and they have a thing for young men.

        "No, I mean using computers and other machines to create a whole world inside your head."

        "Oh. That's what we used to think drugs were for."

        "Yeah, I know. And drugs are okay, to a certain point. But they're... crude. Unpredictable."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Reality Artist">
        <prolepsis>I think about this for a minute. "But this virtual reality of yours, it's something you can control?"

        He sat up. "It's something you can work with."

        I am watching the joggers. Thais is the one I fancy. Thais of the lyrelike hips. She looks our way as she goes past,
        smiles and cocks an eyebrow.

        "But if you can control this fantasy world," I say, forcing myself back to the conversation, "then surely others can
        too. Aren't you worried about, what did you call them, the Suits?"

        Leroy waved to Thais and stuck out his lower lip dismissively. "What do Suits know? That's the whole point of
        being a reality artist."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Beautiful People">
        <prolepsis>"A what?" I say.

        "A reality artist. You don't just get to tell stories or write songs or make images — you get to create a whole world,
        which is not a control thing at all, it's like, something you can't predict, a living organism. Something people can play
        into, play around in, using it to create wonderful things. The Suits can't comprehend."

        It sounds so familiar. I f‌ind myself thinking of peace, love, happiness, that whole dream. So I ruffle his mop and
        hand him another beer. "You're a beautiful person, Leroy. Just like your mother."

        "Thanks. I like you too."</prolepsis>

        Harley struggled up to a sitting posture, locking his hands behind the small of her back, holding her to him, her legs
        wrapped tight around his hips. "What colors do I make you see?"

        "Mostly pastels so far," she teased him. "Lots of beige."

        "Bullshit." He kissed her.

        "Mauve. Platinum. Tasteful beige."

        "Cafe au lait. Copper pennies. Deep Dutch chocolate."

        She took him inside her and they put the world away.
    </div>

    <div title="Blood &amp; Agression">
        "Well one thing's for sure" Thea said, "war isn't the movies. It's about cold hard realities. It's about things like
        economics and physics and chemistry."

        "Realities? What realities?" Leroy countered. "You've been a professor too long Mom. Those are academic
        departments."

        Where, Thea wondered, did the kid get all these brains. But he had a point. "Yeah, and let's not forget Rhetoric
        while we're at it. Okay, try again: real waris about blood," she told him. "Blood and aggression."

        Leroy shook his head. "Is it really that simple? I mean, speaking of rhetoric — 'blood and aggression,' whose
        rhetoric is that? You could be one of Bush's speechwriters. Saddam is the aggressor and the Kuwaitis are his
        bloody victims. How can you argue with that?"
    </div>

    <div title="Cyclops">
        <prolepsis>"You can't," Thea answered, "as long as war is television. But once you put out the cyclops eye you can start to
        ask some interesting questions. Like, who was it that backed Saddam for eight years in the war with Iran? Who
        looked the other way when he 'accidentally' blew up one of our navy ships in the Gulf? Whose ambassador told him
        we weren't interested in his disputes with Kuwait? And let's not forget who conspired with the Saudis to drive
        down the price of oil and make it impossible for Iraq to repay its war debts?"

        Leroy frowned. "You're saying it's our fault Saddam invaded Kuwait? You're saying he has a right to grab all those
        oilf‌ields?"

        "Not at all. I'm saying we should have thought this through before we sent in the troops, and certainly before we go
        starting something. Okay, maybe we're just there to keep the peace — though it seems strange to send 50,000 GI's to
        do that. But you can't achieve peace without justice. I thought we'd learned that lesson."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Justice?">
        <prolepsis>"I don't know," Leroy said. "You throw around words like 'reality' and 'justice' like you know what they mean. That's
        okay for you. But I don't know what those words mean. And what if they don't really have anything behind them?"

        "Like father, like son." This made him grimace. It was a cheap shot, but not inaccurate.

        "Blood and aggression, okay. Maybe that's what makes the world go around, and maybe we just have to accept it.
        Okay, say the price of oil is unfair to Iraq. But if the price of oil went up to three or four dollars a gallon, you and
        Dad might lose your nice college jobs because all of a sudden nobody could afford the tuition."

        Thea stared at him. "Well, kiddo, you certainly are confused. A while ago you were asking about protests. Now it
        sounds like you want to join the Marines."

        Leroy shook his head. "I just don't know. I feel restless and unsure about things."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Your Old Man">
        <prolepsis>"So what does your father have to say for himself these days?" Thea asked her son.

        "Not a whole lot. He was real mellow for a change. He's got a new love interest so he's looking better. He's taken
        off some weight."

        "Spare me the particulars."

        "Jocelyn. She's 28 and an ethnobotanist."

        "So was Carlos Castaneda."

        "Who?"

        "Think of Shirley Maclaine on very strange drugs."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Misguided &amp; Dangerous">
        <prolepsis>"Oh." Leroy started to pull off his Nikes but decided he'd wait till his mom had another cigarette. "Mainly what we
        talked about was you," he told her.

        She f‌inished her bourbon and thought about another but felt reluctant somehow. "I'm touched. What could your
        dear old dad possibly have to say about me?"

        "He says you're getting famous because of the Western Civ thing." Famous, was it? "He also says he thinks you're
        misguided and dangerous."

        "Good old Frank."

        "He says you always were a closet Maoist."

        <analepsis>Time was,</analepsis> Thea ref‌lected, <analepsis>when that little description had been a term of endearment. But that was another century.</analepsis></prolepsis>

    <div title="Frank Disclosure">
        <prolepsis>"Your father, Franklin D. Sieger," Thea told the boy, "was a founding member of SDS at Berkeley, did you know
        that?"

        The look she got was appallingly blank. "Star Wars stuff? But I thought Dad did Ezra Pound."

        "Students, not Strategic. Another century." She saw it click: oh, the sixties, right. "Think of Michael Stipe with real
        politics."

        Leroy worked on that one. "You mean Dad used to be a liberal?"

        "Once upon a time," she said, "your daddy thought of himself as an anarchist. But he was wrong. He was only an
        asshole."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Edible">
        <prolepsis>Thea decided she would have that second drink after all. Just say now.

        "Did you always hate men?" Leroy wanted to know.

        "Yeah." She came back with the whisky bottle and put her arms around his spare stringbean shoulders. "You know,
        I'm one of those frigid unfuckable radical dyke types who's really just frustrated because the only man she wants
        between her legs is the one who started out there in the f‌irst place. Sonny boy."

        He grinned and kissed her cheek. "Thanks, mom. I always thought so."

        She gave him a squeeze. "You're good enough to eat, you know that?"

        "I could use a shower, though."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Frank Opinion">
        <prolepsis>Thea refreshed his memory about where the bathroom was, respecting his privacy while he shucked of‌f his road gear
        and climbed in the shower. She considered chucking the whole ensemble out the window toward the dumpster but it
        occurred to her that Leroy couldn't wear her jeans anymore and she didn't think he'd enjoy hanging out in a f‌lowered
        robe till she could get to the mall. She thought about calling Harley, who was about Leroy's size, but thought better
        of it. The little Runbird wouldn't be pleased.

        She drif‌ted back to her main preoccupation. "So just out of foolish curiosity, what does your old man think I should
        be doing instead of agitating?"

        Leroy stuck his soggy head out of the shower. "Wha?"

        Thea took a seat on the commode. "What does Firebomb Frank think I should be doing with Western Civ?" She
        passed him the conditioner.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Rooting for the Iceberg">
        <prolepsis>"I probably don't remember all of it," Leroy told her, "but mainly he thinks it's too late to save the country. He says,
        like, the American economy is bankrupt and the culture is almost in the same shape so basically we should hang out
        and see if we can do any better under the Japanese."

        "That's your dad." Thea was laughing. "We used to get stoned and watch this old movie about the Titanic. A
        Night to Remember. Frank always rooted for the iceberg."

        Leroy cut the water and reached for a towel. "I love him just like I love you, Mom, but y'know I think you're both a
        couple of bullshit artists."

        Thea thought about it. "The dif‌ference is, I believe in my brand of bullshit."

        "I'm sure you do, Mom."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Belief System">
        <prolepsis>"What about you, Roy?" Thea asked him as he towelled off. "Have you found some bullshit to believe in yet, or
        doesn't that come along with puberty anymore?"

        He gave her a protesting look and tried to cover as much of himself as possible with the towel. Which at six-one
        wasn't easy. "Actually I'm glad you asked me that question, Ma. I've been meaning to have this talk with you."

        "I presume you don't mean about eggs and sperms and masturbation."

        "Nah. I mean the one about blood and oil and demonstrations."

        you get back to the world.

        Beyond that, some of these BOYS wouldn't mind nuking Badgag just for drill
        (well only with TACTICAL stuff, OK). I guess most of us hope what we're
        doing comes down to a standoff, tho how long could that last. I don't even
        want to think.

        Anyway, I spose you'd have to say what that reporter said about the Vietnam

        Snyder thought about it. "You can't go back," he allowed. "Like most everything I can name, with one or two
        exceptions, it's a young man's game. Aviation in particular. I f‌lew choppers, Hueys, recon and air rescue. It was a
        def‌inite rush, that I will not deny. I got it so bad that I joined up with the Border Patrol in '77 because I thought
        they'd let me stay in the air."

        Madden nodded and ordered another round. You heard your share of war stories in this line of work.

        "Once or twice a month Divisional Intelligence would get some kind of Resistance Assessment hardon and all the
        single guys would get out the deck and draw. Low card got to take the newest bird on the lot for a twenty minute
        tour up B-B Alley. What we'd do when he got back, if he managed it, was we'd walk around his ship and tote up the
        holes. The ones in your own ass didn't count."

    <div title="Blood">
        <prolepsis>"It isn't just about the rush," Madden pointed out. "It's about guys dying."

        Madden winced heavily. The fates and the media had not been kind to Jerzy Majdanov: a.k.a. Gerard Madden. If it
        wasn't bad enough he bore the same last name as John Madden, coaching legend network zany, and hardware
        salesman nonpareil, there was this uncanny resemblance. That's right, the same big bluf‌f horsey face, the same
        bushy brow and silly cowlick, the very same size 46 defensive tackle build. Gerry was about an inch shorter than his
        video alter ego, but anybody can tell you that people always look bigger on the tube.

        "Come on," Snyder goaded, "do it." Three of their fellow federales saw who it was Snyder was drinking with and
        started a spontaneous popular demand. "Do it, do it, do it."

        "Aw, come on, fellas, really."

        <prolepsis>"MAD-den, MAD-den."
        "Come on, Gerry, show us what you do when you execute a collar."

        "Aw cripes." After nearly ten years Madden was well and truly tired of this game, but here was Nicky Cott from
        DEA with Madden's favorite single malt, and well, you know these guys.

        Madden got down from his stool, came up behind Snyder, planted his hammy hooks either side of the suspect's
        tanned neck. The bar fell silent, expectant.

        Madden pursed his lips. "DOINK!"

        been cute and sensitive like you-know—who,</analepsis> but f‌inally because watching the color commentary got to be like

        says. "Excuse me, Mr. Madden, the gentleman in 4-C asks if you wouldn't mind an autograph." Madden turns
        around, sees this dude in a suit costs more than he owes on his mortgage. Dude looks familiar. Madden goes over
        and asks who he should make out the autograph to. The dude says, "Best Regards to Ivan Figueroa and all my fans
        in Newport."

        Madden makes out the autograph, Ivan takes it from him and gets a little puzzled. "What's this, ain't your real name
        John, and what's these three letters after your name: F-B... ay, caramba.."

        "Eh?"

        Dreams they do complicate one's life. <analepsis>Urquhart was in Tokyo some years back, just coming out of a twelve hour
        snooze and the worst phase of his jetlag, when what should come wafting in on the August breeze but the sound of
        a P.A. truck rolling through the neighborhood. The driver was chanting something over and over in a mournful
        pentatonic way, as if he were a Shinto muezzin.

        Urquhart heard and was instantly back in that dream. Only this time, with a sudden pulse of heart-wrenching terror,
        he realized that he could make out — or was about to understand — what the Caller was saying. He very nearly
        screamed.

        It turned out the truck was from a recycling company, offering to exchange rolls of toilet paper for bundles of old
        newsprint.</analepsis>

        They took Urquhart outside the Administration Building and stood him against the wall. Flash units f‌ired, TV spots

        Camden? Thea said. Does that mean you're back in school, Veronica?

        Witchhunting was more than history in the Madden family. <analepsis>It had been so ever since Madden's father, a special
        investigator for the Commerce Commission in a midwestern state, was pink-slipped (in every sense) in the winter of
        1952.

        There was an administrative hearing during which no material evidence of disloyalty was produced. But it was

        Days, weeks, months, almost a year now back in the life, back in the Real World. If that's what you call it. Emily’s
        not so sure.

        Four in the moming. She collects jacket, shoulder bag, car keys. She moves through the house with no particular
        delicacy, f‌iguring he's in his usual f‌latline state, sleeping the sleep of the just insane. She looks in on him, sees him
        sprawled not so much on the old mattress as halfway inside the wretched thing. His sleep is impenetrable.

        So with a sigh she hauls on the jacket and drops down the stairs to the carport, not thinking, not thinking, just
        letting her body do what it wants with this sudden need for motion.

        She gets in the car and drives out.

        Veronica got up very slowly. At f‌irst Thea thought she hadn't heard or understood. She thought the younger
        woman was headed for the bathroom or into the kitchen for a beer.

        But Veronica was just standing there by the wall with her back to Thea, her arms drawn inward, her hands at work on
        something. In the dark Thea couldn't quite make it out.

        "Veronica?"

        And then all of a sudden Veronica hit the lights and Thea saw her standing there with her blouse in her hands and
        her right arm stretched above her head to show the f‌ine tracery of cuts, the deepening bruise lines along her ribs.

        "What do you think?" she said.

        Doing it as prescribed, keeping the badge handy but leaving his reach hand free, Madden grasped the handle of the
        garage door, thinking it was surely locked down or wired to an automatic opener; though you never knew, it was
        worth a try.

        The door f‌lew up. An antique, and the lock long since broken. "Boris Urquhart?"

        "You're Madden. You know Harley."

        "I'm with the Bureau, and this is business." He f‌lashed the badge and stepped inside, sizing up the situation —
        which was tricky enough all right. Those shades and that beret, now what was supposed to make of them? He knew
        full well what they probably meant. True there was no hard proof, and the beefs involved were local matters,
        nothing above a misdemeanor, certainly nothing Federal.

        On the other hand, Urquhart was cleared Top Secret. For the moment.
    </div>

    <div title="Trigger">
        <prolepsis>"Business?" Urquhart asked, crossing over to a battered old wardrobe, reaching in for something.

        Madden wasn't much pleased with this. "Say Boris," he called over, leaving the edge on his voice. "It's sort of dark
        in here, and I've got these dangerous ref‌lexes. Call me an old paranoid, but humor me and come out with whatever
        that is real slow, okay?"

        Urquhart froze for a second, then backed away from the wardrobe very slowly. He was holding up a set of khaki
        fatigues, neatly hung and pressed. He peeled back the zipper and patted down the pockets the better to set
        Madden's mind at rest.

        "Sure am sorry about that," Madden told him. "It's just I hate accidents, you know?"

        Urquhart eased off his leather jacket, keeping his hands visible. "Everyone's on a hair trigger these days."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Ha Ha">
        <prolepsis>"So what's this business you need to discuss with me at ten o'clock on a Thursday night?" Urquhart asked. His
        tone was polite but there was something odd in his voice.

        "Could we go inside?" Madden asked.

        "I'm on my way out."

        Madden shrugged. "I really only need a minute of your time. Just a couple of questions, really."

        "Pardon me if I don't say 'shoot.'"

        Madden smiled; Urquhart didn't. Madden noticed.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Query">
        <prolepsis>"First question," Madden said, taking out a steno pad. "How long has it been since you last logged onto your
        SIMUNET account?"

        Urquhart stepped into the legs of the coveralls, trying to remember. SIMUNET provided time-sharing access to
        military supercomputers. It had been set up some months ago for a series of system simulations. Security was
        heavy, partly because the subject of the models was an orbital defense system — but mainly because the models
        always failed in the most embarrassing ways.

        "I've done my best to forget that particular project," Urquhart said. "As far as I can recall, I haven't been on
        SIMUNET since about the middle of last April."

        Madden listened carefully, using his best detective's ear. Though as he knew, his own impression hardly mattered.
        Sooner or later they'd have to wire Urquhart up and see what came out on the graphs.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Who's More Paranoid?">
        <prolepsis>"And you haven't divulged your SIMUNET password to any friends or acquaintances?"

        Urquhart zipped up his fatigues and stared at him f‌latly. "Oh of course. Every time I shit in a public john, I write
        each and every password for all my computer accounts in large block letters on the stall door. Right under my
        unlisted phone number, the access code for my automatic teller card, and the amazing length of my willy."

        "Yeah, well. I had to ask."

        "I'm a computer scientist, Agent Madden. That means there are some things I'm even more paranoid about than
        you."

        Madden watched him straightening his epaulets in the side mirror of the Porsche. "I guess so."</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Suspicions">
        <prolepsis>"Okay, second and f‌inal question," Madden said. "Do you know an undergraduate student named Judith Sloan
        Busch?"

        Urquhart thought about it, then nodded. "I direct her senior research project."

        "And does that project involve access to secure time-sharing systems?"

        "Of course not, and that was a third question."

        Madden shrugged. "Guess I lost count." Madden jotted a short note on his steno pad. "So you have no reason to
        believe that Ms. Busch may be involved in network security violations?"

        Urquhart opened the door of the Porsche, then turned to face Madden. He took off his shades and gave him his
        hardest look straight on. Madden was used to it.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Your Input">
        <prolepsis>"Jude Busch is a philosopher, not a hacker," Urquhart told him. "She's not the type to crack systems. Try again."

        Madden made another note. "Well okay then. As always, we appreciate your input."

        Urquhart said nothing, just slid into the seat, kicked down the clutch pedal and twisted the key. The engine shook
        itself awake.

        "I may have to contact you again later," Madden warned, half shouting over the yowl of the exhaust.

        Urquhart slipped the parking brake and started to back out, f‌lipping Madden a brief salute. "I guess so."
        Madden waved bye-bye.</prolepsis>
    </div>

    <div title="Pursuit">
        <prolepsis>Madden watched Urquhart swing out of the drive and straighten his wheels. His mind settled into familiar grooves
        again. He was running on ref‌lex once more, this time a set of responses keyed to pursuit, run and go seek, catch you
        later.

        Urquhart was trying to notch up into f‌irst and Madden was just strolling out of the garage, totally casual this, while
        his hands went down into his pockets after his keys and he was counting the steps to his car, converting steps to
        seconds, multiplying seconds times road speed, checking out the likely routes, trying to predict turns and evasions.
        Okay, let's go.

        Urquhart found his gear and took off with a tiresmoking lunge onto East Main. Madden broke into a sprint.</prolepsis>

        Urquhart blinked into the light. The light blinked into his eyes. Into his head.

        Wait...

        "This is an interesting trick I learned during my years in the Viennese circus," he heard Tate saying.

        The light f‌lashed into Urquhart's eyes. A regular rhythm but slow, very slow. On... Off... Inexorable. The rhythm...

        No, stop...

        The light f‌lashed on again and 0ff. Off again and on. The rhythm was intimate, familiar. It touched something inside

        You know what really scares me, Emily, it's the changes. What scares me
        most is the thought of you changing.

        What will you be like when I see you again? I try to picture your face
        coming down the airplane steps, sunburnt and thinner. Tougher, maybe. Same
        old Emily? I don't know.

        Will you really be able to go back to the way you were, hanging out and
        not-writing your thesis, watching Boris through his ups and downs, or who
        knows, maybe taking up with this other fellow you

        Will you be happy back here under the big old trees, sitting in seminar or

        I am scared for you, Emily, but what scares me most isn't the bombs or the
        gas. As you said it's the changes, and what scares me most is the thought
        of you changing.

        What will you be like when I see you again? Will you be the same old Emily,
        lazy and smart-assed as ever? Are we going to slide back into the life we
        had, staying up past closing in the No and bitching about everything that's
        rotten in Tara. Are we still going to have our Sunday afternoons at the
        Creek, drinking too much of that wine and hiding the car keys from Urquhart.
        Will I ever get to see you in that silly old sundress of mine again?

        I am scared for you, Emily. We're all targets these days, it's true. I'm

        Still somehow I feel that you're sitting at the worst kind of bullseye |
        there in the thick of it but not at the front, like those poor bastards in
        Beirut. God I hope I'm wrong about that. Watch your ass and come home
        safe. I may not agree with you but I do love you, kiddo.

        What scares me more, though, isn't really the bombs or guns or gas. As
        you've said, it's the changes: and what scares me most is the thought of you
        changing.

        What will you be like when we all see you again? Same old Emily? | why do I
        doubt that? What scares me is that you've made your separate peace, you've
        found a way to get along in the game.

        Boris holds up his f‌ingers V and says: This is the Problem.

        But you don't get it, do you. Boris lifts up his mask and underneath he's wearing a face you've never seen before
        though you suspect it may belong to the invisible Man.

        Jude is holding up Boris's f‌ingers too, and she adds: The Problem is that This Isn't The Answer.

        — Nuh-uh, you assent, I don't think this is the answer to anything.

        Wearing his invisible face Boris begins to weep invisible tears and in a f‌lash of empathy you feel inside yourself that
        he is mourning for his own failure, your failure, and the failure of everyone here to f‌ind any kind of answer.

        "Glorious," she said again, but this time with a little edge to it. "As glorious as all the rest?"

        "Was it so glorious, for instance, when you used to make it with Thea?"

        He tried to massage the tension out of her shoulders but it wouldn't go. "That was ten years ago. More," he said
        quietly.

        She held her peace for a while, her body telling him clearly enough that she wasn't pleased. "I'm sorry," she said
        f‌inally. "I know it was a long time ago. There are just times when I can't help feeling haunted."

        through f‌limsy sunbelt insulation into outer darkness. He could try to be Outside but it wasn't happening. The
        voices would f‌ind him here.

        Things didn't sound promising back in the other world. Though Urquhart could not make out a single word, the
        tones of voice told him everything. The newshounds had their blood up. Something nasty was in the off‌ing.

        IT'S THE GRANULARITY, FOOL...

        And maybe you're wondering — Granularity? What's this mean?

        — Well, says Boris, it seems the contours of this ontozone are driven by a simple bipolar causal-connective
        combinatory matrix of the second order, which follows from the limitation to a dialectic of presence/nonpresence
        down among the hedgerows which is where you'll f‌ind me.

        — Forget it, Jude assures you, it's all just a two-bit show.
